Am F C G x2

Am           F
I miss those blue eyes
C               G
How you kiss me at night
Am         F        C  G
I miss the way we sleep
Am              F
Like there's no sunrise
C                 G
Like the taste of your smile
Am         F         C   G
I miss the way we breathe

             F (strum once)
But I never told you
                   C (strum once)
What I should have said
             F (strum once)
No, I never told you
               C (strum once)
I just held it in

G
And now,
Am          F         C    G
I miss everything about you
Am                 F          C    G
Can't believe that I still want you
    Am            F                C       G
And after all the things we've been through
Am          F          C
I miss everything about you
G
Without you

Am F C G

Am         F
I see your blue eyes
C           G
Everytime I close mine
Am          F          C  G
You make it hard to see
Am           F
Where I belong to
C            G
When I'm not around you
Am            F        C   G
It's like I'm alone with me

             F (strum once)
But I never told you
                  C (strum once)
What I should have said
            F (strum once)
No, I never told you
               C (strum once)
I just held it in

G
And now,
Am         F         C     G
I miss everything about you
Am                F         C       G
Can't believe that I still want you
    Am            F              C          G
And after all the things we've been through
Am          F        C
I miss everything about you
G
Without you
