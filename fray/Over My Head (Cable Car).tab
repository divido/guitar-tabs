--- Verse 1 ------------------------------------------------
  Cmaj7
I never knew

  Em7             G              Cmaj7
I never knew that everything was falling through

     Em7        G                Cmaj7
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue

   Em7      G              Am     G       D
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

                    Cmaj9
But that's how it's got to be

     Em7            G                 Cmaj9
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy

    Em7            G              Cmaj9
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see

    Em7       G           Cmaj9    Am      D
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears and

She's on.. your..  mind

--- Verse 2 ------------------------------------------------
      Cmaj9
Let's rearrange

  Em7             G                Cmaj9
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage

     Em7          G             Cmaj9
Just say that we agree and then never change

   Em7   G            Am       G     D
Soften a bit until we all just get a-long

           Cmaj9
But that's disregard

    Em7          G              Cmaj9
You find another friend and you discard

       Em7      G             Cmaj9
As you lose the argument in a cable car

    Em7  G           Am     G        D
Hanging above as the canyon comes between and

    Cmaj9        Em7         G       Cmaj9
And suddenly I become a part of your past

      Em7        G               Cmaj9
I'm becoming the part that don't last

    Em7    G            Am
I'm losing you and it's effortless

Cmaj9                   Em7          G
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground

       Cmaj9
In the throw around

      Em7              G         Cmaj7
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down

I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves and
