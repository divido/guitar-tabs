A                      C#m
Looking for something I've never seen
E                    A
Alone and I'm in between
A                                C#m
The place that I'm from and the place that I'm in
   E            A
A city I never been
A                         C#m
I found a friend or should I say a foe
       E                               A
Said there's a few things you should know
A                           C#m
We don't want you to see we come and we go
      E                 A
Here today, gone tomorrow

A
We're only taking turns
C#m            E
Holding this world
A
It's how it's always been
C#m                        E      A
When you're older you will understand

C#m  E  A

A                            C#m
If I say who I know it just goes to show
          E                     A
You need me less than I need you
A                         C#m
Take it from me we don't give sympathy
          E                 A
You can trust me trust nobody
A                               C#m
But I said you and me we don't have honesty
       E                         A
The things we don't want to speak
A                       C#m
I'll try to get out but I never will
E                        A
Traffic is perfectly still

A
We're only taking turns
C#m            E
Holding this world
A
It's how it's always been
C#m                        E      A
When you're older you will understand

C#m         E              A
And then again maybe you don't
C#m         E              A
And then again maybe you won't
C#m                     E          A
When you're older you might understand
C#m                     E          A
When you're older you might understand
