And So It Goes  - Billy Joel

C       F7+              Am2    Am
In every heart there is a room
C               F       G
A sanctuary safe and strong
C       F7+              Am2    Am
To heal the wounds from lovers past
C       F       F7+     C
Until a new one comes along

C       F7+              Am2    Am
I spoke to you in cautious tones
C                       F       G
You answered me with no pretense
C       F7+             Am2 Am
And still I feel I said too much
C       F       F7+     C
My silence is my self defense

C7        F7+           F      C
And every time I've held a rose
Am         D    F        G4     G
It seems I only felt the thorns
C7        F7+          F       C
And so it goes, and so it goes
Am         D    D7       G4    G
And so will you soon I suppose

C       F7+              Am2    Am
But if my silence made you leave
C                      F       G
Then that would be my worst mistake
C      F7+               Am2      Am
So I will share this room with you
C       F       F7+             C
And you can have this heart to break

C7         F7+          F       C
And this is why my eyes are closed
Am         D    F         G4   G
It's just as well for all I've seen
C7        F7+          F       C
And so it goes, and so it goes
Am         D    D7      G4  G
And you're the only one who knows

C       F7+             Am2      Am
So I would choose to be with you
C                     F         G
That's if the choice were mine to make
C       F7+            Am2   Am
But you can make decisions too
C        F     F7+              C
And you can have this heart to break
