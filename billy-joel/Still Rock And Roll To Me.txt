C                          Em
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
          Bb                       F
“Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?”
C                       Em
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars
        Bb                 F
“Welcome back to the Age of Jive.
Em                         Am
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
    Em                          D              G
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.”
C           Em                Bb         F
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound, funny,
         Am             G       C
but it's still Rock and Roll to me.
C                          Em
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
          Bb                    F
“Can't you tell that it's out of style?”
C                     Em
Should I get a set of white-walled tires?
        Bb                       F
“Are you gonna cruise the Miracle Mile?
Em                    Am
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental;
     Em                      D          G 
your best bet's a true, baby blue Continental.”
C         Em         Bb           F
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk,
     Am             G       C
it's still Rock and Roll to me.
C   G                           F
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
           E                        Am
cause it's always been the same old scene.
          G                        F
There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound 
       E              Ab    Eb                    F    G
from a story in a magazine..aimed at your average teen.
C                   Em                     Bb
How about a pair of pink Sidewinders and a bright 
               F
orange pair of pants?
C                     Em                         Bb
“You could really be a Beau Brummel, baby, if you just give 
          F      
it half a chance.”
Em                          Am
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
    Em                      D             G
you get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.
C           Em        Bb           F
Next phase, New Wave, dance craze, anyways
     Am             G       C
it's still Rock and Roll to me.

C                     Em
Should I try to be a ‘straight A’ student?
       Bb                     F   
“If you are then you think too much.
Em                       Am
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?
Em                           D           G
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.”
