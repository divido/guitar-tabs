Otis Redding - Dock of the Bay

Play verses as barre chords, sliding up and down the neck.

G              G/A/Bb  B7
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
        C                C/B/Bb  A
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
G            G/A/Bb     B7
Watching the ships roll in
           C              C/B/Bb A
And then I watch 'em roll away   again, yeah


    G                          E
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
              G                          A
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
        G    E
Wastin' time


  G            G/A/Bb  B7
I left my home in      Georgia
C               C/B/Bb  A
Headed for the 'Frisco  Bay
G               G/A/Bb     B7
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
              C              C/B/Bb  A
And look like nothin's gonna come my way


                  G                      E
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
         G                          A
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        G    E
Wastin' time
G     D     C               G
Looks like, nothing's gonna change
G     D            C         G
Everything still remains the same
G       D       C          G
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
F                 D
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes


G            G/A/Bb     B7
Sittin' here resting my bones
         C                C/B/Bb   A
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
     G            G/A/Bb  B7
It's two thousand miles I roamed
        C         C/B/Bb  A
Just to make this dock my home
 

                   G                      E
Now I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
         G                          A
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        G    E
Wastin' time
