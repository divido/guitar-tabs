[Verse]

Em             C                  G
Come on skinny love just last the year
Em             C                   G
Pour a little salt we were never here
        Em        C                     G
My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...
               Am                        Em
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
Em        C                G
I tell my love to wreck it all
Em              C                G
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
        Em        C                    G
My my my - my my my - my my my my my
             Am                 Em
Right in the moment this order's tall


[Chorus]

  G                        Em            C
I told you to be patient I told you to be fine
  G                        Em            C
I told you to be balanced I told you to be kind
         G
In the morning I'll be with you
            Em              C
But it will be a different kind
          G
I'll be holding all the tickets
               Em            C
And you'll be owning all the fines


[Verse]

Em            C                 G
Come on skinny love what happened here
Em            C                  G
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
        Em        C                  G
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
        Am                         Em
Sullen load is full so slow on the split


[Chorus]

   G                        Em           C
I told you to be patient I told you to be fine
   G                       Em            C
I told you to be balanced I told you to be kind
     G                           Em             C
Now all your love is wasted then who the hell was I?
                G
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
           Em              C
And at the end of all your lines


[Bridge]

G                  Em         C
Who will love you? who will fight?
G                  Em      C
And who will fall, far behind?
Em             C           G   C
Come on skinny love ........
        Em        C                     G
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
        Em        C                     G
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
