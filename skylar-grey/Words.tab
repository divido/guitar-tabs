Tuning standard
Capo 3

Intro: Em G D C D x2


Verse 1:
Em
 Always in a rush
  G
Never stay on the phone long enough
   D                    C  D
Why am I so self-important?
Em
 Said I'd see you soon
      G
But that was, oh, maybe a year ago
 D                               C  D
Didn't know time was of the essence

Em
 So many questions
G                      D
 But I'm talking to myself
                              C
I know that you can't hear me anymore
    D
Not anymore
Em
 So much to tell you
G                    D
 And most of all goodbye
                                  C
But I know that you can't hear me anymore


Chorus:
D        Em
It's so loud,
    G
inside my head
       D
With words that I,
        C
should have said
D      Em
As I drown,
     G
in my regrets
     D
I can't take back,
      C       D     Em
the words I never said
          G
I never said
     D
I can't take back,
      C       D     Em
the words I never said


Verse 2:
Em
 Always talking shit
  G                               D
Took your advice and did the opposite
                         C       D
Just being young and stupid, and I...
Em                                             G
 I haven't been all that you could've hoped for
                                    D
But if you'd held on a little longer
                                    C        D
You'd have had more reasons to be proud, and I...


Em
 So many questions
G                      D
 But I'm talking to myself
                              C
I know that you can't hear me anymore
    D
Not anymore
Em
 So much to tell you
G                    D
 And most of all goodbye
                                  C
But I know that you can't hear me anymore



Chorus:
D        Em
It's so loud,
    G
inside my head
       D
With words that I,
        C
should have said
D      Em
As I drown,
     G
in my regrets
     D
I can't take back,
      C
the words...


Bridge:
    D         Em
The longer I stand here,
                G
the louder the silence
                    D                               C
I know that you're gone, but sometimes I swear that I hear
     D               Em
Your voice when the wind blows,
                   G
so I talk to the shadows
                     D                            C
Hoping you might be listening cos' I want you to know


Chorus:
D        Em
It's so loud,
    G
inside my head
       D
With words that I,
        C
should have said
D      Em
As I drown,
     G
in my regrets
     D
I can't take back,
      C       D     Em
the words I never said
          G
I never said
     D
I can't take back,
      C       D     Em           G
the words I never said, I never said
   D
I can't take back,
    C             G
the words I never said...
