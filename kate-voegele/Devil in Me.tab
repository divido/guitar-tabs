--- Verse 1 ------------------------------------------------

Dm         C         Bb          C                   Dm
Far in the distance, this is the view from the other side.

          C        Bb      A
How did I let this pass me by?

Dm              C        Bb      C                        Dm
You took me for granted, planted thorns in this garden of mine.

             C          Bb       A
What are the chances my hope has died?

Dm                 Gm                    C                  G7
Please have mercy, you've unnerved me, I don't deserve this pain, no.

--- Chorus -------------------------------------------------

F                 C                    Dm           C
So don't break my heart, I ain't never done nothing to deserve this.

F        C                      Dm             C
I'm torn apart, you've had your fun, do you suppose I earned it?

Bb         C           F      F/E     Dm
Do you not see how I'm begging on my knees?

           Gm          Dm           C                      Dm
No, don't speak, don't breathe, you bring out the devil in me.

Thinking it over, those were days dark ebony nights

The end of October seemed like a lifetime.

Dm         C           Bb     C                     Dm
I had a suspicion, but didn't want to believe you a liar.

You had a mission to prove me right.

Dm                 Gm                 C                A
You took my trust, ground it to dust, found out I know better. Yea-yeah.

And I don't wanna feel the pain, and I don't want another day shackled to your ball and chain.
