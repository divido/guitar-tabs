ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
--KATE VOEGELE

Capo 3


INTRO:  Em  C   D  Em  C   D


   Em                                      C
I can tell by the way you been yelling her name
                       D
that it's more than a friendly game
Em                                           C                       D
With a smile and that I’m-gonna-fight-to-the-death expression in her eye


G                          Am         D
You think I’m so dramatic, just imagining again
Em                       Am                     B   C
You come to her defense, insisting that she’s innocent
C           G                 Em              D                    C
Well excuse me for wanting to be the one and only lock to fit your key
      C                            Em          B                  Em
You believe there's nothing up her sleeve, but baby just wait and see



CHORUS:
Em                               C          D
You say that love is blind, well I say open up your eyes
Em                         C               D
She’s a mastermind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Em                      C              D         Am
Who’s the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
        C         D
I’ll be gone one way or another


Em   C   D  Em  C  D


Em                                      C
Take a minute to see it from my side of things;
                          D
don't you think you would feel the same?
Em                                             C        D           G
Like you still gotta play for the victory in a game you won yesterday
G                             Am                  D
I shouldn't have to fight for something that's already mine
Em                         Am             B           C
But her pursuit of you has undermined my peace of mind


C           G              Em
But it's no use crying to you,
                D                        C
you’re who her plan has done the damage to
                G
What’s done is done,
                       Em
I should just hold my tongue-
      B
but someone has got me outdone


CHORUS:
Em                               C          D
You say that love is blind, well I say open up your eyes
Em                         C               D
She’s a mastermind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Em                      C              D         Am
Who’s the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
        C         D
I’ll be gone one way or another


BRIDGE:

Em C

D             Em    C
You’re going under
    D           Em    C   D
And baby its no wonder
               Am
She’s stepping up her game
D                             Am
Making you a prisoner of her hall of fame
D                             Am
Looking for a winner for her trophy case
D                              Am          Bm
You need to consider what you think you deserve
         C              D
Is that all that you’re worth? No, no, no, no, no



CHORUS:

Em                               C          D
You say that love is blind, well I say open up your eyes
Em                         C               D
She’s a mastermind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Em                      C              D         Am
Who’s the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
        C         D
I’ll be gone one way or another



Em                               C          D
You say that love is blind, well I say open up your eyes
Em                         C               D
She’s a mastermind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Em                      C              D         Am
Who’s the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
        C         D
I’ll be gone one way or another
