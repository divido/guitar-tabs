Am Em x2 Am Em F G

Am                       Em
 I never feared the unexpected
        F                G
 Until I found myself in this peculiar place
Am                      Em
 Unaware of where I was headed
        F                     G
 Oh, It turns out it was your footsteps I had chased


F         G                  Am         Em
 Well I should know so much better than this
F           G            Am           D   F
 But you've occupied the center of my universe


Am          Em
 I'm moving in reverse
Am          Em
 Under your mighty curse
F          G
 I hate myself for loving you
Am         Em
 I turn my head away
Am            Em
 But my heart will remain
F                      G                   Am Em x2 F G
 Until the day I learn you're no good for me


Am                          Em
 It's illogical and it's outrageous
     F              G
 The way I let you keep me hangin' along
Am                         Em
 Your character is that contagious
   F                  G
 I know I should have thought before I had done


F     G               Am            Em
 I've gone and let my impulse be my guide
F       G                   Am                 D F
 And on that note I'll be defenseless for some time


Am          Em
 I'm moving in reverse
Am          Em
 Under your mighty curse
F          G
 I hate myself for loving you
Am         Em
 I turn my head away
Am            Em
 But my heart will remain
F                      G                   F
 Until the day I learn you're no good for me


F              G
 Hey you there keep your distance
F                G
 Don't you come around here
F              G
 Don't test my patience baby
        F                        G
 'Cause I aint gonna let you off easy

 Oh you're no good, no
Am  G         F
 Oh you're no good, no
G             Am
 Oh you're no good
