2 am and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake

                                     D
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?

I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season

Yeah, we walk through the door so accusing their eyes

                                        D
Like they have any right at all to criticize

                                             Aadd9 * Aadd9
Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason

Life's like an hourglass glued to the table

And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe

May he turned 21 on the base of Fort Bliss

                                           D
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist

                                        Aadd9
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year

Here in town you can tell (she's) been down for a while

But my god it's so beautiful when the (girl) smiles

                                             Aadd9 * Aadd9
Wanna hold (her); maybe I'll just sing about it

We're like cars on a cable and

A                        E
Life's like an hourglass glued to the table

Bm                    D
No one can find the rewind button, (girls)

   A                        E * E
So cradle your head in your hands

    G    D       Aadd9          G    D       Aadd9
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe

--- Bridge -------------------------------------------------
          Bm                        D
There's a light at each end of this tunnel you shout

             A                        E
Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out

      Bm                                D
These mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again

2 am and I'm still awake writing a song

                                      D
If I get it all down on paper it's no longer

                                       Aadd9
Inside of me, threatnin' the life it belongs to

Aadd9                                     G
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd

                                             D
Cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud

                                             Aadd9 * Aadd9
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

Life's like an hourglass glued to the table

No one can find the rewind button, now

Sing it if you understand

    G    D       Aadd9          G    D       Aadd9
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe

whoa breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe, just breathe
