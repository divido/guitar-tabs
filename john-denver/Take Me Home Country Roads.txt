   Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
 G                    Em                  
   Life is old here, older than the trees,
 D       		 	 	    C			 G
younger than the mountains, blowin like a breeze.

   All my memories   gather round her, 
D                   C				 G
   miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
G                   Em                  
   Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, 
D                     	  C			   G
misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

   I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
     C        G             D
the radio reminds me of my home far away.
     Em               F             C              G
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have

been home yesterday, yesterday.
