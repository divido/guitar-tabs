Red, Red Wine
Neil Diamond

Em      A    D   E7
Red red wine,

         A        D
Go to my head,

           A           D
Make me forget that I

               A     Em
Still need her so,

        A     D   E7
Red red wine,

           A         D
It's up to you,

          A             D
All I can do I've done,

                   A     D
But memories won't go,

                   A
No, memories won't go..

       Em
I have sworn,

          A
That with time,

            D                  A
Thoughts of you would leave my head,

      Em          A
I was wrong and I find,

         D                 E7
Just one thing makes me forget...

        A    D  E7
Red red wine,

              A         D
Stay close to me,

             A          D
Don't let me be alone,

              A       D
It's tearing apart

              A
My blue, blue heart.


       Em
I have sworn,

          A
That with time,

            D                  A
Thoughts of you would leave my head,

      Em          A
I was wrong and I find,

         D                 E7
Just one thing makes me forget...

        A     D     E7
Red red wine,

              A          D
Stay close to me,

             A          D
Don't let me be alone,

              A        D(hold)
It's tearing apart

              A     D    E7   A
My blue, blue heart.
