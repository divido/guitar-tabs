 Am                                                            Fm
I'll give you countless amounts of outright acceptance, if you want it

                Am                                                     Fm
I will give you encouragement to choose the path that you want, if you need it

                 Am                                                   Fm
You can speak of anger and doubts; your fears and freak outs and I'll hold it

                            Am                                                      Fm
You can share you so-called shame-filled accounts of times in your life and I won't judge it


and there are no strings attached

                Am                                           Fm
You can ask for freedom as well or time to travel and you'll have it

I bet you're wondering when my conditional police will force you to cough up

                       C                       G                      Am
I bet you're wondering how far you have now danced your way back into debt

You can fall into the abyss on your way to bliss; I'll empathize with

You can say that you have to skip town to chase your passion and I'll hear it
