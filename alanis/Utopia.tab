Intro
 Dm

Verse 1
 Dm                          C
we'd gather around all in a room
            Bb               Am        Bb
fasten our belts engage in dialogue
 Dm                              C
We'd all slow down rest without guilt
                 Bb                  Am      Bb
not lie without fear disagree sans jugement


 Dm
We would stay and repond and expand and include
 C
and allow and forgive and enjoy and envolve
 Dm
and discern and inquire and accept and admit
 C
and divulge and open and reach out and speak up


Chorus 1
Fm                        C
this is my utopia is my utopia
            Fm              C
this is my ideal my end in sight
Fm                  C
utopia this is my utopia
            Fm           C
this is my nirvana my ultimate


Verse 2
Dm                               C
we'd open our arms we'd all jump in
                Bb               Am       Bb
we'd all coast down into safety nets


Dm
we would share and listen and support and welcome
C
be propelled by passion not invest in outcomes
Dm
we would breathe and be charmed and amused by difference
C
be gentle and make room for every emotion


Chorus 2
Fm                        C
this is my utopia is my utopia
            Fm              C
this is my ideal my end in sight
Fm                  C
utopia this is my utopia
            Fm           C
this is my nirvana my ultimate

Verse 3
 Dm                                 C
we'd provide forums we'd all speak out
             Bb                  Am       Bb
we'd all be heard we'd all feel seen

Dm
we'd rise post-obstacle more defined more grateful
C
we would heal be humbled and be unstoppable
Dm
we'd hold close and let go and know when to do which
C
we'd release and disarm and stand up and feel safe


Chorus 2
Fm                        C
this is my utopia is my utopia
            Fm              C
this is my ideal my end in sight
Fm                  C
utopia this is my utopia
            Fm           C
this is my nirvana my ultimate
