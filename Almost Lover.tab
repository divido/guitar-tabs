Intro: Am, F x2

          Am
Your fingertips across my skin
               F/C
The palm trees swaying in the wind
   Am              F/C
Images
            Am
You sang me Spanish lullabies
             F/C
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
       Am
Clever trick

        G                       C
Well, I never want to see you unhappy
 Dm                             G
I thought you'd want the same for me

C
 Goodbye, my almost lover
G
 Goodbye, my hopeless dream
Dm
 I'm trying not to think about you
F
 Can't you just let me be?
C
 So long, my luckless romance
G
 My back is turned on you
Dm
 Should've known you'd bring me heartache
F                    C
 Almost lovers always do


F/C          Am
  We walked along a crowded street
            F/C
You took my hand and danced with me
   Am F/C
Images
             Am
And when you left, you kissed my lips
                      F/C
You told me you would never, never forget
         Am    F/C
These images, no

          G                       C
Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
  Dm                            G

G
Am                   G
 I cannot go to the ocean
                              Am
I cannot drive the streets at night
                           F
I cannot wake up in the morning
                  Em
Without you on my mind
                                G
Well so you're gone and I'm haunted
                       F -
And I bet you are just fine


Did I make it that
  Dm
Easy to walk right in and out
            G
Of my life?

C
 Goodbye, my almost lover
G
 Goodbye, my hopeless dream
Dm
 I'm trying not to think about you
F
 Can't you just let me be?
C
 So long, my luckless romance
G
 My back is turned on you
Dm
 Should've known you'd bring me heartache
F                    C
 Almost lovers always do
