Verse 1

A                                  E
There was decorated general with a heart of gold
     Bm                     F#m
That likened him to all the stories he told
   D                    A
Of past battles won and lost and legends of old
E
A seasoned veteran in his own time
       A                     E
On the battlefield he gained respect for fame
     Bm                         F#m
With many medals of bravery and stripes to his name
   D                                     A
He grew a beard as soon as a he could to cover the scars on his face
E
And always urged his men on
           A                            E
But on the eve of great battle with the infantry in dream
        Bm                              F#m
The old general tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning
   D                       A
He awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
E
And walked slowly out his tent

        A                        E
All the men held tall with their chests in the air
         Bm                             F#m
With the courage in their blood and the fire in their stare
             D                         A
And it was a grey morning and they all wondered how they would fare
E
Till the old general told them to go home

He said...

Pre-Chorus
A      E        Bm           F#m     D
I have seen the others and i have discovered
          A                  E
That this fight is not worth fighting
 A       E          Bm            F#m     D
And i've seen their mothers and i will no other
   A                   E
To follow me where i'm going, so...

Chorus

A      E                     Bm
Take a shower and shine your shoes
F#m                D
You got no time to lose
        A                     E
You are young men you must be living  x2

Bridge:
A                 E
Go now you are forgiven

Verse 2

A                                 E
But the men stood fast with their guns on their shoulders
    Bm                      F#m
Not knowing what to do with contradicting orders
    D                                              A
The general said he would do his own duty but he'd extend it no further
E
The men could go as they pleased
A                              E
But not a man moved their eyes gazed straight ahead
     Bm                               F#m
Till one by one they stepped back and not a word was said
    D                                 A
The old general was left with his own words echoing in his head
E
He then prepared to fight

Pre-Chorus
A      E        Bm           F#m     D
I have seen the others and i have discovered
          A                  E
That this fight is not worth fighting
 A       E          Bm            F#m     D
And i've seen their mothers and i will no other
   A                   E
To follow me where i'm going, so...

Chorus

A      E                     Bm
Take a shower and shine your shoes
F#m                D
You got no time to lose
        A                     E
You are young men you must be living  x2
