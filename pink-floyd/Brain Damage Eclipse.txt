ALL THAT YOU TOUCH, AND ALL THAT YOU SEE,

ALL THAT YOU TASTE,  ALL YOU FEEL.
    D                      D7                
AND ALL THAT YOU LOVE, AND ALL THAT YOU HATE,

ALL YOU DISTRUST,  ALL YOU SAVE.
    D                      D7                    
AND ALL THAT YOU GIVE, AND ALL THAT YOU DEAL,

AND ALL THAT YOU BUY, BEG, BORROW OR STEAL.

AND ALL THAT IS NOW, AND ALL THAT IS GONE,

AND ALL THAT'S TO COME, AND EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN IS IN TUNE,
        D7                     Bb   D
BUT THE SUN IS ECLIPSED BY THE MOO- N.
