Intro : C X4

    C                                   Em
Im scared today, more than I told you I was yesterday
                    Am
Give me a moment to catch my breath
             F
And hold me every second left

C                                      Em
Proud of me, thats the only way I want you to be
               Am            F
Look at me and love what you see

Dm                Am                        C   G
  I wont make it alone, I need something to hold

Chorus
C                            G
Kiss me on my shoulder, and tell me its not over
Am                               F
I promise to always come home to you
  C                           G
Remind me that Im older to be brave, smart, sweet, and bolder
    Am                                  F
And dont give up on what were trying to do
G                                          C
Dont count the miles, count the I love yous


C                                            Em
We made it out, and all the other people are asking how
                  Am                F
This doesnt even sound like truth to grow from a bruise
    C                           Em
But one day we will realize how hard it was, how hard we tried
    Am                          F
And how our hearts made it out alive

Dm

Chorus
C                           G
Kiss me on my shoulder, and tell me its not over
  Am                             F
I promise to always come home to you
  C                           G
Remind me that Im older to be brave, smart, sweet, and bolder
    Am                                  F
And dont give up on what were trying to do
G                                 C
Dont count the miles, count the I love yous


              G       B          C
And these are words I wished you said
    G         B      C
But thats not how it went
          G          B         C
Cause you gave up on us in the end
