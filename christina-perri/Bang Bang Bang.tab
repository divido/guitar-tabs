G G Bm Em D C C

G                                         Bm
All my life you know I haven't been very love strong
             Em                     D                     C
there's been so many fights that I fought and I never won
        G                                            Bm
So I decided that I should just give up in trying to right your wrong
    Em                            D                        C
And word on the street is that is she did to you what you did to me...

[Chorus]
C
5, 4, 3 2 1
G
Bang, bang, bang, boy!
             Bm
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
       Em
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
C
Bang, she shot you

Karma tastes so

G
Bang, bang, bang, boy!
             Bm
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
       Em
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
C
Bang, she shot you
                      G
Karma tastes so sweet

      G                                      Bm
So unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you
Em                       D                         C
Bending and breaking the rules that we're making exceptions to
     G                                Bm
But how does it feel, to swim in your own tears
    Em                      D
You lied and you lied and I died and I died
         C
And now you know why...

[Chorus]
C
5, 4, 3 2 1
G
Bang, bang, bang, boy!
             Bm
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
       Em
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
C
Bang, she shot you

Karma tastes so

G
Bang, bang, bang, boy!
             Bm
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
       Em
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
C
Bang, she shot you
                      G
Karma tastes so sweet

G Bm Em D C C

G
Bang, bang, bang, boy
             Bm
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
       Em
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
C
Bang, she shot you

Karma tastes so

G
Bang, bang, bang, boy!
             Bm
You're goin' down, down, down, boy
       Em
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
C
Bang, she shot you
                      G
Karma tastes so sweet

G
Bang, bang, bang, boy
             Bm
You're goin' down
       Em
To the ground
