Capo 3

Em           B
2am where do I begin,
C             G    B
Crying off my face again.
Em                  B
The silent sound of loneliness
C               G     B
Wants to follow me to bed.



      Em          D           G          Em
I'm a ghost of a girl that I want to be most.
        Em          D           Em
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well.




Em                   B
Dancing slowly in an empty room
C                       G        B
Can the lonely take the place of you?
  Em                  B
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
C                      G
Let you go and let the lonely in
           B
To take my heart again



Em            B
Too afraid to go inside
C                        G        B
For the pain of one more loveless night.
Em                      B
But the loneliness will stay with me
C                 G    B
And hold me til I fall asleep.



      Em          D           G          Em
I'm a ghost of a girl that I want to be most.
        Em           D           Em
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well.



Em                   B
Dancing slowly in an empty room
C                       G        B
Can the lonely take the place of you?
  Em                  B
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
C                      G
Let you go and let the lonely in
           B
To take my heart again



Em  D   G  D   Em
Broken pieces of
  Em D   G    D    Am    G
A barely breathing story
Em      D    G   D    C
Where there once was love
Em    D      G D  Am         B B7
Now there's only me and the lonely.



Em                   B
Dancing slowly in an empty room
C                       G        B
Can the lonely take the place of you?

I sing myself a quiet lullaby
C                      G
Let you go and let the lonely in
           B
To take my heart again
