Intro-
G


(G)                                  Bm
 A certain type of wind has swept me up
But till it's found each bone I
        Cadd9
I'm overcome
                                       G
There is an icy breath that escapes my lips
And I am lost again



(G)                                   Bm
A certain type of darkness has stolen me
                               Cadd9
Under a quiet mask of uncertainty
                                     G
I wait for light like water from the sky
And I am lost again



       Cadd9                 G
In the sea of lovers without ships
                   Em7                    Dsus4
And lovers without sight, you're the only way out of this
Cadd9                G
Sea of lovers losing time
                  Em7                   Dsus4   Cadd9*
And lovers losing hope, will you let me follow  you

    Dsus4*   G*  Cadd9* Dsus4* G*
Wherever you go, bring  me     home



G                                       Bm
A certain type of silence has filled my voice
                                       Cadd9
I scream beneath the water and make no noise
                                    G -once
All my prayers were quiet and never heard
And I am lost again




       Cadd9                 G
In the sea of lovers without ships
                   Em7                    Dsus4
And lovers without sight, you're the only way out of this
Cadd9                G
Sea of lovers losing time
                  Em7                   Dsus4   Cadd9*
And lovers losing hope, will you let me follow  you

    Dsus4*   G*  Cadd9* Dsus4* G*
Wherever you go, bring  me     home



G                                   Bm

        Cadd9
I'm overcome
                                       G
There is an icy breath that escapes my lips
               -stop
And I am lost again



       Cadd9                 G
In the sea of lovers without ships
                   Em7                    Dsus4
