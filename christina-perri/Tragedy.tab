Intro: Dm A

Dm
If you could envision
                 A
The meaning of a tragedy

Ooooooh
Dm                                A
You might be surprised to hear it's you and me
        Dm
When it comes down to it
                   A
You never made the most of it

Ooooooh
Dm                           A
So I cry cry cried but now I say goodbye
Dm                             A
And I won't be made a fool of
                  Dm
Don't call this love

Dm A C G Dm

Dm                                 A
When did you decide I didn't have enough to buy
                         Dm
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
                     A
For the fire and the sleepless nights
Dm                            A
And I won't be made a fool of
                Dm    A
Don't call this love
      C         G
Don't call this love
Dm              A
Lalalalala-love Lalalalalala-love
C          G         Dm
Lalalalala lalalala- love

C                                                          Dm
Why did you feel the need to prove that everybody else was right
N.C.       E7
No I won't fight

Dm A

Dm              A          C
Ohhhh you're my Tragedy... Tragedy
          G         Dm
You're my Tragedy ooohh
     A  C    G
This is ohhh no no no no no
