CAPO on Fret 4

Intro:

C Em F G Em Am

C
Today I'm gonna write a sad song
                   Em
Gonna make it very long
        F            G
So that everyone can see
         Em     Am
That I'm very unhappy

C
Wish I wasn't always wrong
                         Em
Wish it wasn't always my fault
    F                  G
The finger that you're pointing
    Em               Am
Has knocked me on my knees
    D
And all you need to know is
G
I'm so sorry
         Em
It's not like me
     Am
It's maturity
     D
That I'm lacking

   G
So don't
            Em
Don't let me go
            Am
Just let me know
     D               G
That growing up goes slow


C
I wonder what my mom and dad would say
                          Em
If I told that I cry each day
     F              G           Em   Am
It's hard enough to live so far away

C                 
I wish I wasn't always alone
                          Em
I wish I wasn't always so cold
        F        G
But the party is over
Em             Am
How will I get home?
    D 
And all you need is 
G
I'm so sorry
         Em
It's not like me
     Am
It's maturity
     D
That I'm lacking

   G
So don't
            Em
Don't let me go
            Am
Just let me know
     D               G
That growing up goes slow


E                              Am
If all the rules were meant to bend
                          D
And you swore you were my friend
                        G    Em
Now I have to start all over again

E                                 Am
Cause no one's going to take your place
                           D
And I'm scared we'll never save
                      G       Am     D
All the pieces of the love we made

           G
And I'm so sorry
         Em
It's not like me
     Am
It's maturity
     D
That I'm lacking


   G
So don't
            Em
Don't let me go
            Am
Just let me know
     D               G
That I can slip and fall
                     Em
And you won't let me go
            Am
Just let me know
     D               G
That growing up goes slow

           G
And I'm so sorry
         Em
It's not like me
     Am
It's maturity
     D
That I'm lacking


   G
So don't
            Em
Don't let me go
            Am
Just let me know
     D               G
That growing up goes slow
