One Night
Christina Perri

Tuning: Standard

[Intro]
Bm, A, Em, A


[Verse]
  Bm
I feel the way you want me
  A
I see that you are lonely
       Em
If you couldn't know, you'd leave with me
     A
It's more than curiosity
    Bm
And I'm never long for winter
        A
To your presence made me shiver
   Em                                A
Un-tethered you'd be better if you'd only come with me


[Chorus]
    G                     Bm
One night I'll be the moon

Hanging over you
A
(Spilling all over your body)
Em
(Covering all your wounds)
    G                       Bm
One night I will be the star

Falling where you are
A
(Somewhere in the deep of my love)
Em
(Filling your empty heart)
    G                     Bm
One night, one night, one night
    A                     A
One night, one night, one night


[Verse]
       Bm
You've come so close to tasting
       A
Now my innocence is breaking
         Em
Like the ocean in a perfect storm
   A
It makes me want you even more
     Bm
I've never been so jealous
     A
I've never felt so helpless
   Em                           A
So out of breath and hungry for you


[Chorus]
    G                     Bm
One night I'll be the moon

Hanging over you
A
(Spilling all over your body)
Em
(Covering all your wounds)
    G                       Bm
One night I will be the star

Falling where you are
A
(Somewhere in the deep of my love)
Em
(Filling your empty heart)
    G                     Bm
One night, one night, one night
    A                     A
One night, one night, one night


[Bridge]
Em                 A
     Hurry, the sun is waking
Em                      Bm             A
     Darling, don't leave me waiting


[Chorus]
    G                     Bm
One night I'll be the moon

Hanging over you
A
(Spilling all over your body)
Em
(Covering all your wounds)
    G                       Bm
One night I will be the star

Falling where you are
A
(Somewhere in the deep of my love)
Em
(Filling your empty heart)
    G                     Bm
One night, one night, one night
    A                     Em
One night, one night, one night
    G                     Bm
One night, one night, one night
    A                     A
One night, one night, one night

End on G
