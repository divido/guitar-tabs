C                        Am/F
 Woke up such a bad dream
                         C
I stayed you were leaving
With my heart you were stealing
G            E7
I don't care I'd let you take it


C                          Am/F
Showed up, like a good girl
                     C
I fell for your fable
But I'm no Cinderella
G                        E7     C
I don't care I'd let you take it

Put us back together
                      C
You said, it's forever
But I know you're pretending
