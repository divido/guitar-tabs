G               G         G
Starry, starry  night, paint your palette
Am              Am           C
Blue and grey, Look out on a    summer's day,
D                 D         G
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
G             G
Shadows on the hills,
C                    Am
Sketch the trees and daffodills
 C               Am
Catch the breeze and    winter chills, in
D         D            G
colors on the snowy linen land
G                      Am   Am
And now I under stand what you tried to
G               Am         Am
Say to me,  how you suffered for your sanity
       C                G
How you tried to set them free,
C              C               Am
they would not listen, they did not know how,
D                      G
  Perhaps they'll listen        now



G          G         G
Starry, starry       night, flaming flowers that
Am                     Am                    C
Brightly blaze, swirling clouds in violet haze
D                        D                G
Reflecting Vincent’s eyes of China Blue
G                         G
Colors changing hue,
C                         Am
Morning fields of amber grain
C                 Am
Weathered faces lined with pain
D                           D                 G
Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand
G                   Am        Am
And now I under stand what you tried to
G                  Am           Am
say to me,  how you suffered for your sanity

C                  G
How you tried to set them free,
C                      Am
they would not listen, they did not know how,
D                      G
Perhaps they'll listen  now



  C
For they could not love you,
         C              G
 but still your love was true
C                        C
And when no              hope was left in sight
    C              C
On that starry, starry night,
   G            G         G
you took your life as lovers often do
Am                         C
But I could have told you, Vincent, this world was
             D        G
Never meant for one as beautiful as     you



G           G   G
Starry, starry  night, portraits hung in
Am              Am               C
Empty halls, frameless heads on nameless walls
D                     D                 G
with eyes that watch the world and can’t forget
G                    G
Like the strangers that you’ve met
C                  Am
The ragged men in ragged clothes
 C             Am
The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie
D                   D            G
Crushed and broken on the virgin snow
G                          Am        Am
And now I think I know, what you tried to
G         Am        Am
say to me,  how you suffered for your sanity
    C               G
How you tried to set them free,
C                                    Am
They would not listen, they’re not listening still,
D                       G
Perhaps the never will…
