Standard tuning
Capo on 1st fret

[Verse]
         D                     A
When the days are cold And the cards all fold
            Bm                 G
And the saints we see Are all made of gold
           D                        A
When your dreams all fail And the ones we hail
           Bm                  G
Are the worst of all And the blood’s run stale

[Pre-chorus]
D
I want to hide the truth
A
I want to shelter you
Bm
But with the beast inside
G
There’s nowhere we can hide
D
No matter what we breed
A
We still are made of greed
Bm
This is my kingdom come
G
This is my kingdom come


[Chorus]
D
When you feel my heat
A
Look into my eyes
Bm
It’s where my demons hide
G
It’s where my demons hide
D
Don’t get too close
A
It’s dark inside
Bm
It’s where my demons hide
G
It’s where my demons hide


[Verse]
         D                      A
When the curtain’s call Is the last of all
         Bm                       G
When the lights fade out All the sinners crawl
        D                        A
So they dug your grave And the masquerade
           Bm                 G
Will come calling out At the mess you made

[Pre-chorus]
D
Don’t want to let you down
A
But I am hell bound
Bm
Though this is all for you
G
Don’t want to hide the truth
D
No matter what we breed
A
We still are made of greed
Bm
This is my kingdom come
G
This is my kingdom come


[Chorus]
D
When you feel my heat
A
Look into my eyes
Bm
It’s where my demons hide
G
It’s where my demons hide
D
Don’t get too close
A
It’s dark inside
Bm
It’s where my demons hide
G
It’s where my demons hide


[Bridge]
D
They say it's what you make
A
I say it's up to fate
Bm
It's woven in my soul
G
I need to let you go
D
Your eyes, they shine so bright
A
I want to save their light
Bm
I can't escape this now
G
Unless you show me how


[Chorus]
D
When you feel my heat
A
Look into my eyes
Bm
It’s where my demons hide
G
It’s where my demons hide
D
Don’t get too close
A
It’s dark inside
Bm
It’s where my demons hide
G
It’s where my demons hide
