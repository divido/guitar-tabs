Flowers in your Hair

G
When we were younger
We thought everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little
                    Cadd9
And romanticized the time I saw
                     G
Flowers in your hair
        D
Takes a boy to live
      Cadd9                            G
Takes a man to pretend he was there

G
So then we grew a little
Knew a lot
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
             Cadd9
And all the things we said
                         G
We were self assured
        D
It's a long road to wisdom
       Cadd9                         G
It's a short one to being ignored

         Em     D
Be in my eye
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
By in my eye, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart

G
So now I think that I could love you back
And I hope its not too late
'Cause youre so attractive
       Cadd9
And the way you move
                     G
I won't close my eyes
         D
Takes a man to live
        Cadd9                             G
Takes a woman to make him compromise

         Em     D
Be in my eye
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
By in my eye, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart
