Lumineers - Ophelia

[Verse 1]

Dm       Bb           F
  Ah, ah,  when I was young
Dm    Bb               F
  I, I should've known better
      Dm           Bb      F
  And I can't feel no remorse
       Dm            Bb         F
  And you don't feel nothing back

Dm Bb F x2 

Dm     Bb           F
  I, I   got a new girlfriend she
Dm           Bb          F
  Feels like   she's on top
  F    C             Bb      F
  And I   don't feel no remorse
         Dm           Bb        F
  And you   can't see past my blindness


[Chorus]

Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                   Bb                    F
  You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                 Bb                F
  Heaven help the fool who falls in love

Dm Bb F x2 


[Verse 2]

Dm     Bb              F
  I, I   got a little paycheck
         Dm           Bb                F
  You got   big plans    and you gotta move (whoo!)
  F    C             Bb         F
  And I   don't feel nothing at all
F       Dm             Bb      F
  And you   can't feel nothing small


[Pre-Chorus]

F          Bb  F
Honey, I love you
       C       F
That's all she wrote


[Chorus]

Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                   Bb                 F
  You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                 C                 F
  Heaven help the fool who falls in love

Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                   Bb                    F
  You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                 C                 F
  Heaven help the fool who falls in love    

Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                    Bb               F
  You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Dm     Bb  F
  Oh, Ophelia
F                 C                 F
  Heaven help the fool who falls in love
