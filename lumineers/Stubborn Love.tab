(Verse)
F                        Am         C-alt            C
She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
    F                   Am    G*      C
And make you thinks she means it this time
F                     Am       C-alt           C
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
    F                 Am      G*     C
But I still love her, I don't really care

(Bridge)
F            C      Am     G*
When we were young, Oh Oh, we did enough
F           C      Am      G*
When it got cold, Ooh Ooh, we bundled up
F         C     Am    G*                  C
I cant be told, Ah Ah It cant be done

(Same as 1st verse)
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
Pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I wont leave until you come downstairs

(Chorus)
F                 C/G           G    Am
So keep your head up, keep your love
F              C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love [x2]
F              C/G           G    Am
Keep your head up, keep your love

(Same as 1st verse)
I don't blame ya dear for running like you did, all these years
I would do the same, your best believe
The highway signs say we're close, but I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

(Same as 1st bridge)
When we were young oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, Ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, Ah ah, can't be done

(Same as 1st Chorus)
So keep your head up, keep your love
keep your head up, my love [x2]
keep your head up, keep your love
