Bob Seger - Turn The Page

Em - D - Em (2x)
 
     Em
On a long and lonely highway east of Omaha
        D
You can listen to the engine, moanin’ out as one long song,
        A    
You can think about the woman, 
					    Em
Or the girl you knew the night before.
         Em
And your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
            D
When you’re riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
    A                                         
You don't feel much like travelin', 
						  Em
You just wish the trip was through.
 
Chorus:

           D          Em                 D               Em
But here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on the stage,
       D               A                   C  D         Em     
Here I go, playing the star again, there I go, turn the page.
 

    Em
You walk into a restaurant, strung out from the road,
        D
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you’re shaking off the cold,
                 A                           
You pretend it doesn't bother you, 
                             Em
But you just want to explode.
    Em
Some..times you hear 'em talkin', other times you can't,
        D
All the same 'ole cliches : “Is that a woman or a man ?”
        A                                                 Em
And you always seem outnumbered, you dare not make a stand.
 Chorus:

           D          Em                 D               Em
But here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on the stage,
       D               A                   C  D         Em     
Here I go, playing the star again, there I go, turn the page.


Em
Out there in the spotlight, you’re a million miles away,
D
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away,
        A    
And the sweat pours from your body, 
					 Em
Like the music that you play.
Em
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed,
         D
With the echos of the amplifiers, ringin’ in your head,
        A                                                                                    
And you smoke the days last cigarette, 
                         Em 
Remembering what you said.
 
Chorus:

           D          Em                 D               Em
But here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on the stage,
       D               A                   C  D         Em     
Here I go, playing the star again, there I go, turn the page.

           D          Em                 D               Em
But here I am, on the road again, here I am, up on the stage,
       D               A                   C  D         Em     
Here I go, playing the star again, there I go, turn the page.
