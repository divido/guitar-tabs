Intro - Bb F C Dm

Bb                                             F
When i was a kid the things i did were hidden under the grid
C                                                 Dm
Young and naive, i never believed that love could be so well hid
Bb                                            F
With regret I'm willing to bet they say 'the older you get
C                                    Dm
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget
Bb                               F
It gets under your shirt like a dagger at work
C                                    Dm
The first cut is the deepest but the rest still flippin' hurt
    Bb                                   F
You build your heart of plastic, you're cynical and sarcastic
        C
and you end up in the corner on your own

Bb                                       F
'Cos I'd love to feel love, but i can't stand the rejection
  C                         Dm
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
  Bb                              F
I thought i was close, but under further inspection
   C                               Dm
It seems I've been running, in the wrong direction, oh no

Filler - Bb F C Dm x2

           Bb
What's the point in getting your hopes up, when all you're ever getting is
F
choked up?
            C                                Dm
When you're coked up, and can't remember the reason why you broke up
       Bb                                   F
You'll call her in the morning when you're coming down and falling
        C
Like an old man on the side of the road
            Bb
When you're apart, you don't wanna mingle
            F
When you're together you wanna be single
         C                                     Dm
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss that made your heart tingle
         Bb
How much greener the grass is
              F
Through those rose tinted glasses
        C
And the butterflies that flutter by and leave us on our arses

Bb                                       F
'Cos I want to feel love, but i can't stand the rejection
  C                         Dm
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
  Bb                              F
I thought i was close, but under further inspection
   C                               Dm
It seems I've been running, in the wrong direction
        Bb                         F
There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
    C                            Dm
I'd jump in, if it wasn't for my ear infection
Bb                                F
All I want to do is try to make a connection
       C                              Dm
But it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no
