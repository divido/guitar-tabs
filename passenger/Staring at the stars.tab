Easy but great song by passenger. Lyrics aren't perfect but sure the chords are
correct. Work out the rhythm yourself

Capo 5

C Em C Em

Tobacco stains our yellow teeth
And all our fingers and underneath
Our fingernails that clasp on sheets
And we try desperately to sleep

Hearts are sad and eyes are tired
And all this red bull keeps us wired
It gives us wings
It gives us rings around our eyes

F C G Am

We put three sugars in our tea
Sit to watch day time t.v
And laugh at mums who don’t know who the father is

And all our girlfriends are long gone
We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love when you’ve got silicone and strap ons

C Em C Em

And beer bloats our spoilt guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us eyeing up the what’s and if’s and buts and maybe’s and

Falling over in the street
Is just a part of every week
And we lie drunkenly just staring at the stars

F C G Am

Remember when they were in reach
And all the teachers used to teach
You can do anything if you put your mind to it

We put our minds to it all
But disappointment crashed the ball
We could’ve done anything
We just never quite knew it

Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night

Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
Its to be a cold night
