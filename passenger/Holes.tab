Intro:
Amsus  G/B  C  x4

Amsus    G/B          C
I know a man with nothing in his hands
Amsus           G/B    C
Nothing but a rolling stone
Amsus       G/B            C
He told me about when his house burnt down
Amsus       G/B         C
And lost everything he owned

Amsus   G/B       C
He lay asleep for six whole weeks
Amsus                    G/B       C
They were gonna ask his mother to choose
Amsus                  G/B                C
When he woke up with nothing he said I'll tell you something
Amsus                                G/B      C
When you've got nothing you've got nothing to lose

              F
Now I got a hole in my pocket
    C
A hole in my shirt
    G                       Am
A whole lot of troubles he said
     F                                  C
But now that the money's gone well life carries on
       G                          Am
And i miss it like a hole in the head

Instrumental:
Amsus  G/B  C   x4


Amsus     G/B       C
I know a woman with kids around her ankles
     Amsus   G/B  C
And a baby on her lap
           Amsus       G/B   C
She said one day her husband went to get a paper
            Amsus     G/B       C
And the motherfucker never came back
Amsus       G/B     C
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise
     Amsus  G/B            C
But keeping wolf from the door
             Amsus         G/B            C
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the doors double locked
    Amsus        G/B     C
So why ya gotta worry me for

               F
Now he left a hole in my heart
   C
A hole in a promise
    G                     Am
A hole on the side of my bed
     F                      C
But now that hes gone well life carries on
       G                           Am
And i miss him like a hole in the head

         F                C                   G
Well sometimes you cant change and you cant choose
         F                  C                   G
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose

             Dm           F
Now we got holes in our hearts
              C            G
Yeah we got holes in our lives
             Dm            F                C
Well we got holes we got holes but we carry on
x 2

             Dm           F
Say we got holes in our hearts
              C            G
Yeah we got holes in our lives
             Dm            F                C
Well we got holes we got holes but we carry on
