Dm, Gm, F, C, F, Am7, Dm, Gm, F, C, Cadd4, C

           Dm                     Bbmaj7
Well grey clouds wraped round the town like elastic
 C                            F         Am7
Cars stood like toys made of Taiwanese plastic
    Dm                          Bbmaj7                C    Cadd4    C
The boy laughed at the spastic dancing around in the rain
       Dm                               Bbmaj7
While laundrettes cleaned clothes, high heals rub toes
 C                          F        Am7
Puddles splashed huddles of bus stop crows
  Dm                             Bbmaj7                        C    Cadd4    C
Dressed in their suits and their boots well they all look the same


   Bb                       C                   F            Am7         Dm      C
I took myself down to the cafe to find all the boys lost in books and crackling vinyl
     Bb                 C                     F    F7
And carved out a poem above the urinal that read
            Bb
Don't you cry for the lost
  C
Smile for the living
 F           Am7       Dm               C
Get what you need and give what you're given
 Bb                        C
Life's for the living so live it
                      Dm
Or you're better off dead


Gm, F, C, F, Am7, Dm, Gm, F, C, Cadd4, C

          Dm                      Bbmaj7
While the evening pulled the moon out of it's packet
  C                            F          Am7
Stars shone like buttons on an old man's jacket
    Dm                   Bbmaj7                         C    Cadd4    C
We needed a nail but we tacked it 'til it fell of the wall
       Dm                              Bbmaj7
While pigeon's pecked trains, sparks flew like planes
     C                            F       Am7
The rain showed the rainbows in the oil stains
       Dm                       Bbmaj7                C    Cadd4    C
And we all had new iPhones but no one had no one to call


    Bb                       C
And I stumbled down to the stomach of the town
           F           Am7     Dm          C
Where the widow takes memories to slowly drown
        Bb                     C                   F    F7
With a hand to the sky and a mist in her eye she said
            Bb
Don't you cry for the lost
  C
Smile for the living
 F           Am7       Dm               C
Get what you need and give what you're given
 Bb                        C
Life's for the living so live it
                      Dm
Or you're better off dead

( Am, Bb, F, Am7, Dm, Am, C, Cadd4, C ) x2

          Dm                       Bbmaj7
Well I'm sick of this town, this blind man's forage
      C                          F             Am7
They take your dreams down and stick them in storage
         Dm                             Bbmaj7                      C    Cadd4    C
You can have them back son when you've paid off your mortgage and loans
    Dm                           Bbmaj7
Oh hell with this place, I'll go it my own way
       C                        F             Am7
I'll stick out my thumb and I trudge down the highway
 Dm                     Bbmaj7         C    Cadd4    C
Someday someone must be going my way home

          Bb                        C
Till then I'll make my bed from a disused car
        F           Am7           Dm         C
With a mattress of leaves and a blanket of stars
           Bb                       C                         F    F7
And I'll stitch the words into my heart with a needle and thread
            Bb
Don't you cry for the lost
  C
Smile for the living
 F           Am7       Dm               C
Get what you need and give what you're given

You know life's for the living so live it
                      F    F7
Or you're better off dead

Don't you cry for the lost

Smile for the living

Get what you need and give what you're given
