CAPO 3

 [Am]haven't really ever found a place that I call [F]home
I [Am]never stick around quite long enough to [F]make it
I a[Am]pologise that once again I'm not in [F]love
But it's not as if I [Am]mind that your heart ain't exactly [F]breaking
It's just a [Dm]thought, only a [G7]thought

But if my [C]life_[G]__ is for [F]rent
and I [C]don't [G]learn to [F]buy [G]
Well I de[C]serve nothing [G]more than I [F]get [G]
'Cos nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine

I've [Am]always thought that I would love to live by the [F]sea
To [Am]travel the world alone and live more [F]simply
I have [Am]no idea what's happened to that [F]dream
'Cos there's [Am]really nothing left here to [F]stop me
It's just a [Dm]thought, only a [G7]thought

But if my [C]life_[G]__ is for [F]rent
and I [C]don't [G]learn to [F]buy [G]
Well I de[C]serve nothing [G]more than I [F]get [G]
'Cos nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine

But if my [C]life_[G]__ is for [F]rent
and I [C]don't [G]learn to [F]buy [G]
Well I de[C]serve nothing [G]more than I [F]get [G]
'Cos nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine

While my [C]heart is a [G]shield and I [Dm]won't let it [G]down
While I am [C]so afraid to [G]fail so I [Dm]won't even [G]try
Well how can [Dm]I say I'm a[G7]live?

But if my [C]life_[G]__ is for [F]rent
and I [C]don't [G]learn to [F]buy [G]
Well I de[C]serve nothing [G]more than I [F]get [G]
'Cos nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine

If my [C]life_[G]__ is for [F]rent
and I [C]don't [G]learn to [F]buy [G]
Well I de[C]serve nothing [G]more than I [F]get [G]
'Cos nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine
Nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine
Nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [F]mine
'Cos nothing I [C]have_[G]__ is truly [C]mine
