Eagles - Already Gone

        G                 D                C
Well, I heard some people talkin just the other day
         G                   D           C
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
                      G                 D
But let me tell you I got some news for you
           C
And youll soon find out its true
                G               D                C
And then youll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

         G D     C
cause Im already gone
       G  D   C
And Im feeling strong
       G  D              C               G   D       C
I will sing this victory song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo

    G               D                C
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
      G                       D                 C
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
G             D                       C
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
    G                     D                 C
You can see the stars and still not see the light  thats right

       G D     C
And Im already gone
       G  D   C
And Im feelin strong



       G  D              C              G   D       C
I will sing this victory song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo

       G              D              C
Well I know it wasnt you who held me down
       G               D             C
Heaven knows it wasnt you who set me free
   G              D               C
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains
       G          D                C
And we never even know we have the key

       G D    C
But Im already gone
       G  D    C
And Im feeling strong
       G  D              C
I will sing this victory song
          G D     C
cause Im already gone
       G D      C
Yes Im already gone
       G   D  C
And Im feelin strong
       G  D              C
I will sing this victry song
         G  D    C
cause Im already gone
        G  D    C
Yes, Im already gone
G   D   C
