Esus4: 022200		B7: x21202

Intro: E Esus4 (x2)

     E            A           	   E        A
      I like the way your sparklin’ earrings lay
     E              A       B7      
      against your skin so brown.
     E                A                    E       A
      And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
     E                 A          B7
      with a billion stars all around. 

Chorus:             A              E
	'cos I got a peaceful, easy feeling,
     A                             B7
      and I know you won’t let me down.
                E   F#m       A
      cos' I'm  a...already standing
    B7         E
      on the ground.

Interlude: E  Esus4  (x2)

     E         A          E     A
      I found out a long time ago
     E                 A           B7      
      what a woman can do to your soul.
     E         A                 E    A
      Ah, but she can’t take you any way
     E                   A          B7
      you don’t already know how to go. 

Chorus

Instrumental verse

     E            A             E    A
      I get this feeling I may know you
     E      A            B7      
      as a lover and a friend.
     E           A                    E            A
      But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear,
               E            A         B7
      tells me I may never see you again. 

Chorus
