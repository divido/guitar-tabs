Peter Hollens Version, Capo 1

INTRO: Without Music

Oh misty eye of the Mountain below,
Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
Keep watching over Durin’s sons.


Am   F    G    Am x2


VERSE 1:


              Am     C
If this is to end in fire,
              G        Dm
Then we shall all burn together,
          Am           C
Watch the flames climb higher,
G        Dm
Into the night.
        Am        C
Calling out father oh,
G            F
Stand by and we will,
          Dm          Em
Watch the flames burn on and on,
    F       G
The mountainside,


Am    F    G    Am x1


VERSE 2:


                 Am    C
And if we should die tonight,
          G       Dm
We should all die together.
        Am       C
Raise a glass of wine,
G       Dm
For the last time.
        Am         C
Calling out father oh,
   G         F
Prepare as we will,
          Dm          Em
Watch the flames burn on and on,
    F       G
The mountainside.
   Dm      Em             F         G
Desolation comes upon the sky.


CHORUS 1:

          Am     F
Now I see fire,
G          Am
Inside the mountain.
      Am        F
I see fire,
G           Am
Burning the trees.
          Am     F
And I see fire,
G         Am
Hollowing souls.
      Am      F
I see fire,
G            Dm
Blood in the breeze.

And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.

Am    F    G    Am x2


VERSE 3:


             Am     C
Oh should my people fall then,
       G       Dm
Surely I’ll do the same.
            Am       C
Confined in mountain halls,
           G            Dm
We got too close to the flame.
        Am         C
Calling out father oh,
G                F
Hold fast and we will,
          Dm          Em
Watch the flames burn on and on,
    F       G
The mountainside.
   Dm      Em             F         G
Desolation comes upon the sky.


CHORUS 2:

          Am     F
Now I see fire,
G          Am
Inside the mountain.
      Am        F
I see fire,
G           Am
Burning the trees.
          Am     F
And I see fire,
G         Am
Hollowing souls.
      Am      F
I see fire,
G            Dm
Blood in the breeze.

And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.


BRIDGE:

           Dm       Am
And if the night is burning,
       C        G
I will cover my eyes,
           Dm      Am
For if the dark returns,
        C             G
Then my brothers will die.
           Dm             Am
And as the sky is falling down,
             C              G
It crashed into this lonely town.
              Dm              C
And with that shadow upon the ground,
          F                G
I hear my people screaming out.




CHORUS 3:

          Am     F
And, I see fire,
G          Am
Inside the mountain.
      Am        F
I see fire,
G           Am
Burning the trees.
          Am     F
And I see fire,
G         Am
Hollowing souls.
      Am      F
I see fire,
G            Am
Blood in the breeze.
      Am
I see fire,
        F                 G
(Oh you know I saw a city burning.)
Am
Fire.
          Am
And I see fire
          F              G
(Feel the heat upon my skin.)
Am
Fire.
          Am
And I see fire,
      F          G
ooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Am
Fire.
          Am         F
And I see fire burn on and on,
    G       Am
The mountainside.
