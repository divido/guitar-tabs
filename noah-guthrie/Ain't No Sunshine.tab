NO CAPO

[Intro]

Am Em G  (x3)
Am


[Verse 1]

                             Am     Em G Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Am                        Am        Em G Am
It's not warm when she's away.
Am                            Em                              Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long,
                  Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.

                              Am     Em G Am
Wonder this time where she's gone,
Am                      Am       Em G Am
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                             Em                                 Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,
                  Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.


[Interlude]

Am
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Am
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Am
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Am           Em                                 Dm                          Am
I should leave the young thing alone, but this house just aint a home.... anytime.
             Em                                 Dm                        Am  Em  G  Am
I should leave the young thing alone, but this house just aint a home anytime...

[Chorus]

Am                                                   Em  Am
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
Am                                                   Em  Am
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Am                                                Em  Am
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Am                                               Am
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did


[Chorus]

Am           Em                   G             Dm
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
Am                       Em                         G                    Dm
You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up
Am                     Em                     G                         Dm
Like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Am                                            E                    Am
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Am                                            E                    Am
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Am                                            E                    Am
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Am                                            E                    Am
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe*

[Outro]

Am        Em G  Dm
Anytime
Am        Em G  Dm
Anytime
Am          Em G  Dm
She goes away
Am          Em G  Dm
She goes away
Am             Am         Em G  Dm
Oooo she goes, she goes away
Am          Em G  Dm
She goes away
           Am
She goes away
