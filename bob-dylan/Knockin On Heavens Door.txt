G              D            Am
Mama take this badge off of me
G       D          C
I can't use it any-more
G            D                        Am
It's getting dark, too dark to see
G          D                   C   
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door

G             D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 
G           D           Am
Mama put my guns in the ground
G       D              C
I can't shoot them any-more
G               D               Am
That long black cloud is comin' down
G          D                    C   
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door

G             D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 
G    D    Am          
 Oo - oo - oo - oo
