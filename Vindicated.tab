CAPO 1

INTRO: D B A G

D                 Bm
Hope dangles on a string
                      A                              G
Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out
                               D
The shine of it has caught my eye And roped me in
  Bm              A
So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing
      A
I am captivated...I am

Chorus:

D                 G                       Bm
 Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right

          A                          D
I swear I knew it all along And I am flawed

         G
But I am cleaning up so well
      Bm                               A
I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself

Verse 2
   D
So clear
                          Bm                        A
Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions

                    G                                       D
Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye

                  Bm            A
And rendered me So isoloated, so motivated

      A
I am certain now that I am....

:Repeat Chorus:

Bridge
  G
So turn
                       Bm
Up the corners of your lips
                             A                          G
Part them and feel my finger tipsTrace the moment, fall forever

G                         Bm
Defense is paper thin Just,one touch and I'd be in
     A                       A
Too deep now to ever swim against the current
                 D                     Bm
(So let me slip away.. So let me slip away
               A
So let me slip Away
                 G
So let me slip against the current 2x)

Repeat Chorus


        D
Slight hope
                Bm
It dangles on a string
                      A
Like slow spinning redemption...
