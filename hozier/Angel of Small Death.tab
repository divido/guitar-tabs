Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene
Hozier

Capo 2

Em                       B9            Em
I watched the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Em                       B9        Em
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
D                         G
Calling to join them, the wretched and joyful
Em                         B9       Em
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Em                        B9       Em
Freshly disowned, in some frozen devotion
Em                 B9           Em
No more alone or myself could I be
D                           G
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
Em                        B9           Em
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

         Em                       G
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
         Em                          G
With her straw blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Em                     B9            Em
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Em                         B9          Em
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
D                          G
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
Em                         B9          Em
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

         Em                       G
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
         Em                          G
With her straw blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Em                         B9         Em
In leash-less confusion, I wander the concrete
Em                    B9        Em
Wonder how better now having survived
D                            G
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat
Em                    B9           Em
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth, I'm alive

         Em                       G
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
         Em                          G
With her straw blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

         Em                       G
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
         Em                          G
With her straw blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
