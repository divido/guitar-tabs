[Intro]

G


[Verse]

G           C
I had a thought, dear
          Em
However scary
             C
About that night
                   G
The bugs and the dirt
              C
Why were you digging?
              Em
What did you bury
               C
Before those hands pulled me
           G
From the earth?
G            C
I will not ask you where you came from
G           Em
I will not ask and neither should you


[Chorus]

G           C                      Em
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
               C                      G
We should just kiss like real people do


[Verse]

G             C
I knew that look dear
               Em
Eyes always seeking
                C
Was there in someone
                G
That dug long ago
               C
So I will not ask you
               Em
Why you were creeping
             C              G
In some sad way I already know


[Chorus]

G            C
So I will not ask you where you came from
G           Em
I will not ask and neither should you

G           C                      Em
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
               C                      G
We should just kiss like real people do

G             C
I could not ask you where you came from
G             C         D           G
I could not ask and neither could you

G           C                       Em
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
              C                     G
We could just kiss like real people do
