Intro: Em B7 C G B7 Em x2


Em          B7        C
When I was a child, I heard voices...
Em        C                     B7
Some would sing and some would scream
Em      B7            C
You soon find you have few choices...
Em             C              B7
I learned the voices died with me

Em          B7               C
When I was a child I'd sit for hours
Em      C        B7
Staring into open flame
Em        B7      C
Something in it had a power,
Em          C            B7
Could barely tear my eyes away

Em     B7          C
All you have is your fire...
Em     C                 B7
And the place you need to reach -
Em       B7   C
Don't you ever, tame your demon
C7         B7           Em
But always keep 'em on a leash

Intro: x1

Em        B7        C
When I was 16 my senses fooled me
Em         C              B7
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
Em         B7               C
I knew that something would always rule me...
Em        C              B7
I knew the scent was mine alone

Em     B7          C
All you have is your fire...
Em     C                 B7
And the place you need to reach -
Em       B7   C
Don't you ever, tame your demon
C7         B7           Em
But always keep 'em on a leash

Em          B7              C
When I was a man I thought it ended
Em     C                  B7
When I knew loves perfect ache
Em               B7     C
But my peace has always depended
Em         C          B7
On all the ashes in my way

Em     B7          C
All you have is your fire...
Em     C                 B7
And the place you need to reach -
Em       B7   C
Don't you ever, tame your demon
C7         B7           Em
But always keep 'em on a leash
