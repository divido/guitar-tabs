Slow dancing on the boule-vard in the quiet moments while the city's

G           G                          C      G           C     G
still dark.  Sleepwalking throught the summer rain in the tired spaces

D        G
you could hear her name.

(Strum with rythm)
             C9                      Em                       D

that you lost.

Night swimming in her diamond dress making small circles move across the sufrace

G                       C      G            C    G        D       G
Stand watching from the steady shore laying wide open and waiting for

          C9                          Em                  D
something warm and tender while she's moving further from you there was nothing

           G*                   C9                  Em

was your world   just came down.

Day breaking on the boule-vard feel the sun warming up your secondhand heart.
