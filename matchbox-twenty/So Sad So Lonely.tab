HEY!
A5
I found out, on a late night drive
E5                         E
In my winter coat, with my bloodshot eyes
A5                     Am
My faith ain't been no friend to me
        E5
And the way I sin is hanging off of me

Dm      Am   E7
And I'm sorry you can't take me anywhere
Dm                 Am
Pretty soon we're almost there, Baby
E5             E7
One more night, It's been a long long drive

Any you're way way tired, I don't need no backup plans

Am                   E
I said I don't want nobody
       E7        Am
Nobody don't want me
                    E
Hell, I'm so sad so lonely
                             Am
I'm always landing on my feet

A5                     Am
One more time, with a sad sad smile
         E5
And your white-bread friends
       E7
In the circus life
        A5                   Am
All the one way rides and the sweet beginners
               E
passing on the left hand side
       E7
With a sideways smile

Dm      Am    E              Am
And I'm always one step from stallin'
Dm            Am
That dress can make me stall
E               E7
Dance all night, with your ass on fire

And your hands up high, and feel me one more time

Am                   E
I said I don't want nobody
       E7        Am
Nobody don't want me
                    E
Hell, I'm so sad so lonely
                             Am
I'm always landing on my feet


SOLO

Am
Well I learned to love myself
      E7
And I don't need no-one else

And when a love moves on 'cause it gets cold
     Am
Then another moves in and it can fill the hole
                                  E7
I'm one more hopeful lying on the bedroom floor

No sense trying when the whole thing drops

You lose your nerve

I hope you get what you deserve

Am                   E
I said I don't want nobody
       E7        Am
Nobody don't want me
                    E
Hell, I'm so sad so lonely
                             Am
I'm always landing on my feet

Am                 E
Yeah, I don't want nobody
       E7        Am
Nobody don't want me
                    E
Hell, I'm so sad so lonely
                             Am
I'm always landing on my feet

Continue with Am for 2 bars then end abruptly with a HEY! shout.
Listen to the song for the rhythm.
I can't work out the solo, any help here would be great thanks.
