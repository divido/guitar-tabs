C
Someday they'll find our small town world,

On a big town avenue,

When they're talking to you,

Gonna make you brake out of your shell,

Cuz they tell you to,

Better than the truth,

They'll tell you everything,

You wanted someone else to say,

F
They're gonna brake your heart.

    F
But no one's tried to give you,

Lay all your troubles down,

C
Somebody oughta take you in,

Try to make you love again,

Try to make you like the way they feel,

When they're under you skin.

Never once to you think that they would lie,

When they're holding you,

You'll start to think,

You where born blind.
