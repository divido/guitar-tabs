Wait a minute, baby.

Stay with me awhile.

Said you'd give me light

              Am                      G
But you never told me about the fire.

F               Dm
Drowning in the sea of love

      Bbdim5                 C
Where everyone would love to drown.

But now its gone.

It doesn't matter what for.

         Bbdim5
When you build your house,

     C
Then call me home.

           F
And he was just like a great dark wing

           G
Within the wings of a storm.

              Am
I think I had met my match.

       G               F
He was singing ... and undoing.

      G
And undoing.

         F
Ooh, the laces.

            G
Undoing the laces.

F Dm Bbdim5 C
     Ooh.  Ooh.

     F
Said Sara.
           Dm
You're the poet in my heart

Bbdim5
Never change.

C
Never stop.

F
But now it's gone.

           Dm
It doesn't matter what for.

             Bbdim5                      C
But when you build your house, you better call me home.

F G

F
Hold on. The night is coming.

        G
And the starling flew for days.

         F
I'd stay home at night all the time.

       G
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere.

           F
Ask me and I'm there. Yeah.

           G
Ask me and I'm there, 'cause I care.

F

       Dm
In the sea o' love

      Bbdim5                 C
Where everyone would love to drown.

    F
But now it's gone.

            Dm
They say it doesn't matter anymore.

       Bbdim5
If you build your house,

           C
Then please call me, call!

F                Dm
Sara, you're the poet in my heart.

Bbdim5
Never change,

              C
And don't you ever stop.

      F
Well, now it's gone.

             Dm
No, it doesn't matter anymore.

         Bbdim5
When you build your house,

         C
I'll come by.
