Intro: C  Am :||3x  Em
   C             Am           C             Am
Somewhere in between the beginning and the end
   C                 Am                  Em
September took the tourists and settled in for good
   C                 Am
We could hear the trains again
   C                 Am
Brooklyn girls in scarves
   C             Am         Em
Summer left and no one said a word

      C            Em         C            D
And we'd open your window and stay in your bed
      C          Em           D
All day 'til the streetlights came on


     Am           Em         Am            Em    D
What happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms?
     Am           Em           D
What happened to feeling cheap radio songs?
     Am           Em           C         D
What happened to thinking the world was flat?
     Am                 Am
What happened to that?


   C          Am      C               Am
So up on 59th street right before the rains
  C             Am         Em
Lovers catching taxis going downtown
   C                  Am
I'm talking to what's left of you
   C                Am
I'm watching what I say
  C             Am               Em
Counting all the freckles on your perfect face


    C         Em        C           D
You open your window, I sit on your bed
    C          Em            D
Just waiting for right words to come


    Am           Em         Am            Em    D
What happened to bulletproof weeks in your arms?
     Am           Em           D
What happened to feeling cheap radio songs?
     Am           Em           C         D
What happened to thinking the world was flat?
     Am                 Am
What happened to that?

What happened to feeling cheap radio songs?
     Am           Em           C         D
What happened to thinking the world was flat?
