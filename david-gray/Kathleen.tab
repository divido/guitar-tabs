Lay down my head by the wayside

My worn out shoes

Quite why she (left) I can't decide
D                C
But I sure could use
Em  C        G
One plate of food steaming and hot
Em    C     G
Clean linen ironed
Em   C          G
On a fresh made bed but I ain't got

One salty dime, one salty dime

Just close your eyes it won't take long

It won't hurt a bit

Telling myself I could be strong

Or some such brave bullshit

Trucks are roaring by I'm a red ghost

In their tail light gleam

Em        C          G
Cars they sound like waves that are breaking
Em      C       G
On some distant shore
Em         C             G
I gazed so long into the great aching sky

It seemed that I, I wasn't here no more
Em C       G
My rushing blood was a river
Em C        G
My eyes two stars
Em C       G
My blowing hair all a quiver
D                     C
A whispering field of grass
D                   C
That murmurs as you pass
D             Em         C  G
Oh my darlin' Kathleen
D                      C
That whispers out your name
D             Em
Oh my darlin' Kathleen
D             Em
Oh my darlin' Kathleen
