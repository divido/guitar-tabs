[Verse 1]

F     C     Am       G      F
    Summer comes,   winter fades,
C       Am  G        F
Here we are, just the same,
   C         Am        G             F
We dont need pressure, we donâ€™t need change,
C        Am       G      F   C   Am   G
Lets not give the game away.


F         C     Am      G     F
   There used to be an empty space,
    C     Am     G      F
A photograph without a face,
    C           Am     G          F
But with your presence and your grace,
 C   Am        G        F      F   F
Everything falls into place.


[Chorus]

F                         C
Just please don't say you love me,
          G                Am
'cause I might not say it back,
        F                     C                 G               Am
Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping when you look at me like that.
F                  C              G                    Am
There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at.
F                        C
Just please don't say you love me
G                         F   C   Am   G       F   C   Am   G
'cause I might not say it back.



[Verse 2]

F    C    Am        G       F
   Heavy words are hard to take,
    C    Am      G              F
Under pressure, precious things can break,
    C       Am      G       F
And how we feel is hard to fake,
    C       Am         G       F   F
So let's not give the game away.


[Chorus]

      F                     C
Just please don't say you love me,
          G                Am
'cause I might not say it back,
             F                   C              G               Am
Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping when you look at me like that.
     F                 C               G                 Am
And there's no need to worry when you see just where we're at.
      F                    C
Just please don't say you love me
G                           Am
'cause I might not say it back.


[Bridge]

Am
Fools rush in.
F                        C
And I've been the fool before,
                                     A7
This time I'm gonna slow down,
                                   F
'cause I think this could be more,
                                C  G
The thing I'm looking for.


[Chorus]

      F                     C
Just please don't say you love me,
          G                Am
'cause I might not say it back,
             F                   C              G               Am
Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping when you look at me like that.
     F                 C               G                 Am
And there's no need to worry when you see just where we're at.
      F                    C
Just please don't say you love me
G                           Am
'cause I might not say it back.

      F                     C
Just please don't say you love me,
          G                Am
'cause I might not say it back,
             F                   C              G               Am
Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping when you look at me like that.
     F                 C               G                 Am
And there's no need to worry when you see just where we're at.
      F                    C
Just please don't say you love me
G                           Am
'cause I might not say it back.


[Ending]

      F                    C
Just please don't say you love me
G                           Am
'cause I might not say it back.
