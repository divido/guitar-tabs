Em                   G
 I remember it well
             C              D
The first time that I saw
         C                     D
Your head around the door
           G                  C
'Cause mine stopped working


Em                   G
I remember it well
                 C              D
There was wet in your hair
         C           D
I was stood in stare
       G                 C/D
And time stopped moving

                 G
I want you here tonight
                D
I want you here
             G                           C
'Cause I can't believe what I found
                G                               C
I want you here tonight want you here
G                             C    D              Em
Nothing is taking me down, down, down...

(Repeat chords as before)
Em                   G
I remember it well
                 C              D
Taxied out of a storm
         C           D
To watch you perform
       G                 C/D
And my ships were sailing
Em                   G
I remember it well
                 C              D
I was stood in your line
         C           D   G                 C/D
And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth...

                 G
I want you here tonight
                D
I want you here
             G                           C
'Cause I can't believe what I found
                G                               C
I want you here tonight want you here
G                             C    D              Em
Nothing is taking me down, down, down...

Except you, my love
Except you, my love

Capo 2

Am
Come all ye lost
Dive into moss
                      F
And hope      that my sanity covers the cost
     Dm
To remove      the stain of my love
E
In paper mache
Am-Am(hammer on)x3  E

Am
Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
     F
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
Dm
God will forgive me
    E                      Am         E
But I, I whip myself in scorn, scorn
         Am
I wanna hear what you have to say about me
F
Hear if you're gonna live without me
         Dm            E
I wanna hear what you want
                   Am-Am(hammer)x3  E
I remember December
            Am
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
F
Hear if you're gonna live without me
        Dm              E
I wanna hear what you want
                         Am-Am(hammer)x3  E
What the hell do you want?
