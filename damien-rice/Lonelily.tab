Em Cadd9 G D (hold)

            Cadd9  G
I gave me away
     D                         Em
I could have knocked off the evening
      Cadd9       G         D            Em
But I lonelily landed my waltz in her hands
Cadd9       G         D            Em
In a way I felt you were leaving me
 Cadd9                 G               D (Pause)
I was sure I wouldn't find you at home
           Cadd9  G
And you let me down
     D                         Em
You could have knocked off the evening
       Cadd9        G         D            Em
But you lonelily let him push under your bone
            Cadd9   G
You let me down
  D                  Em
It's no use deceiving
Cadd9                 G               D (Pause)
Neither of us wanna be alone
         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home, you're coming home

          Cadd9   G
I gave me away
     D                         Em
I could have knocked off the evening
     Cadd9      G         D            Em
But I was lonelily looking for someone to hold
 Cadd9       G         D            Em
In a way I lost all I believed in
 Cadd9                 G               D (Pause)
And I never found myself so low
             Cadd9   G
And you let me down
       D                  Em
You could've called if you'd needed
       Cadd9        G         D            Em
But you lonelily got yourself locked in instead
            Cadd9   G
And you let me down
       D                  Em
It's one thing being cheated
 Cadd9                 G               D (Pause)
But you took him all the way through your bed

         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
And now you're coming home (And I'm trying to forgive)
         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home (And I'm trying to forget)
         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home (And I'm trying to move on)
         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home (And you haven't called yet)

         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
And now you're coming home (And I'm trying to forgive)
          Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home (And I'm trying to forget)
         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home (And I'm trying to move on)
         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home (And you haven't called yet)

         Em Cadd9  G    D          Em Cadd9  G
You're coming home, you're coming home

       Cadd9   G
I gave me away
       D                  Em
I could have knocked off the evening
       Cadd9        G         D            Em
But I lonelily loomed her into my bone
            Cadd9   G
You let me down
       D                  Em
There's no use deceiving
 Cadd9      G               D (Pause)
Neither of us wanna be alone
