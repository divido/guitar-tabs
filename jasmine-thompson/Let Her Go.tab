Em C D ??

                        C                       G
Well you only need the light when its burning low
               D                       Em
Only miss the sun when its starts to snow
                C                       G      D(sus4)
Only know your lover when you let her go
                       C                        G
Only know youâ€™ve been high when youre feeling low
               D                        Em
Only hate the road when youre missin home
                C                          G    D(sus4)
Only know your lover when youve let her go
                Em
And you let her go

[Verse 1]
Em                              C
Staring at the bottom of your glass
       D                             Bm
Hoping one day you will make a dream last
                 Em            C        D(sus4)
The dreams come slow and goes so fast
     Em                           C
You see her when you close your eyes
       D                          Bm
Maybe one day you will understand why
                Em        C       D(sus4)
Everything you touch only dies

[Chorus]
                        C                      G
But you only need the light when its burning low
               D                       Em
Only miss the sun when its starts to snow
                C                         G       D(sus4)
Only know your lover when youve let her go
                       C                        G
Only know youve been high when youre feeling low
               D                        Em
Only hate the road when youre missin home
                C                         G       D(sus4)
Only know your lover when youve let her go

[Verse 2]
Em                             C
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
          D                     Bm
Same ol empty feeling in your heart
            Em              C         D(sus4)
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Em                      C
Well you see her when you fall asleep
                  D                Bm
But to never to touch and never to keep
                          Em
Because you loved her too much
         C                D(sus4)
And you dive too deep

[Chorus]
                        C                      G
But you only need the light when its burning low
               D                       Em
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
                C                         G      D(sus4)
Only know your lover when youve let her go
                       C                        G
Only know youve been high when youre feeling low
               D                        Em
Only hate the road when youre missin home
                C                        G     D(sus4)
Only know your lover when youve let her go
                Em
And you let her go
