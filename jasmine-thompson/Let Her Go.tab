                        F                         C
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
               G                      Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              Fsus2                      C      Gsus4
Only know you love her when you let her go
     Em7               F                          C
Only know youâ€™ve been high when you're feeling low
               G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              Fsus2                       C    Gsus4
Only know you love her when you let her go
                Am
And you let her go

[Verse 1]
Am                              F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        G                           Em
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
                     Am              F        Gsus4
But the dreams come slow and they go so fast
    Am                           F
You see her when you close your eyes
       G                        Em
Maybe one day you'll understand why
                Am           F       Gsus4
Everything you touch, surely it dies

[Chorus]
                        F                       C
But you only need the light when its burning low
               G                      Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              Fsus2                       C       Gsus4
Only know you love her when you let her go
      Em7              F                          C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
               G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missing home
              Fsus2                       C       Gsus4
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Am                             F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
          G                     Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
                  Am            F         Gsus4
Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                       F
Well you see her when you fall asleep
                  G                Em
But to never to touch and never to keep
                          Am
Because you loved her too much
           F              Gsus4
And you dive too deep

[Chorus]
                        F                        C
But you only need the light when it's burning low
               G                      Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
              Fsus2                       C      Gsus4
Only know you love her when you let her go
     Em7               F                         C
Only know you've been high when youre feeling low
               G                        Am
Only hate the road when youre missing home
              Fsus2                       C     Gsus4
Only know you love her when you let her go
                Am
And you let her go
