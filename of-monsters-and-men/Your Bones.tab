Capo 3

Verses:
        Bm
In the spring we made a boat
        Bm
Out of feathers, out of bones.
        G           D
We set fire to our homes,
        G               D
Walking barefoot in the snow.
        Bm
Distant rhythm of the drum
       Bm
As we drifted towards the storm.
     G              D
Baby lion lost his teeth,
             G              D
Now they're swimming in the sea.

         Bm
Troubled spirits on my chest
           Bm
Where they laid to rest.
              G            D
The birds all left my tall friend
        G            D
As your body hit the sand.

        Bm
Million stars up in the sky
         Bm
Formed a tigers eye
            G            D
That looked down upon my face,
       G               D
Out of time and out of place.

Chorus:
     Em
So hold on,
G/B            Em
Hold on to what we are,
G/B            Bm
Hold on to your heart.

     Bm
I'm awakened by the sound
     Bm
Of a screaming owl.
        G             D
Chasing leaves in the wind,
      G                 D
Going where we've never been.

         Bm
Said goodbye to you my friend,
       Bm
As the fire spread.
           G             D
All that's left are your bones
          G              D
That will soon sink like stones

Chorus:
  Em
So hold on,
G/B              Em
Hold on to what we are,
G/B              Bm
Hold on to your heart.

Instrumental:  same as verse

So hold on,
G/B             Bm
Hold on to your heart.
