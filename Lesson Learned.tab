Intro

Am
Well the truth it fell so heavy
       C
Like a hammer through the room
F                                      C
  That I could choose another over her
F                          Am
  You always said I was an actor, baby
         C                                 G
Guess in truth you thought me just amateur
         Am
That you never saw the signs
         C
That you never lost your grip
         F
Oh, come on now
                         C
That's such a childish claim
      F
Now I wear the brand of traitor
          Am
Don't it seem a bit absurd
          C                               G
When it's clear I was so obviously framed
          F                               Am
When it's clear I was so obviously framed

Am

        Am
Now you act so surprised
             C
To hear what you already know
F                                      C
  And all you really had to do was ask
F
  I'd have told you straight away
          Am
All those lies were truth
C                                 G
  And all that was false was fact


        Am
Now you hold me close and hard
                 C
But I was like a statue at most
  F                                C
Refusing to acknowledge you'd been hurt
           F
Now you're clawing at my throat
           Am
And you're crying all is lost
         C                              G
But your tears they felt so hot upon my shirt
         F                              Am
But your tears they felt so hot upon my shirt

       Am
Was it you who told me once
            C
Now looking back it seems so real
F                                  C
  That all our mistakes are merely   grist for the mill
F                          Am
  So why is it now after I had my fill
         C                                         G
That you steal from me the sorrow that I've earned
         F                           C
Shall we call this a lesson learned?
         F                           Am
Shall we call this a lesson learned?

End on Am
