Depending on which recording you're listening to, he may or may not be playing a half
step up. So you
 can either throw a capo on 1 if you want, or just fiddle with the tuning, or (my
personal fave) just go
for it in open tuning.
The only chords you use in this song are Am, G, C, and very briefly F. (If you're
feelin' fancy, you can
 play the Fadd9 that he uses, but whatev). Also, I would tab out the fingerpicking, and
I might do it
later, but I just figured this out on my ukulele and I'm too lazy to go get my guitar
and figure it out
 right now.



Am           G                   C (x2)

Am                    G                       C
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations,
Am                    G                       C
Oh all my friends are turning green,
Am                    G                       C

Am                         G                       C
this guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City,
Am                 G                       C
this cowboy's running from himself.
Am                             G                       C

Fingerpicking

Am                                   G

Am                                   G

C                                                F (strum and hold)
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

Strum once and hold:
Am                  G                     C
I swear she's destined for the screen,
Am                      G                           C
