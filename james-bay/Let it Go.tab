CAPO 1

[Intro]

C  F  Am7  G x2


[Verse]

C                    F                      Am     G
   From walkin' home and talkin' loads
C               F                           Am     G
   Seein' shows in evenin' clothes with you
C                    F                      Am     G
   From nervous touch and gettin' drunk
C               F                           Am     G
   To stayin' up and wakin' up with you


[Pre-Chorus]

              Am
And now we're slippin' at the edge
G                          Am/F#           Fmaj7
Holdin' somethin' we don't need
            Am
Oh, this delusion in our heads
G                          Am/F#
Is gonna bring us to our knees


[Chorus]

                  F         C
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Am          G
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  F        C
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              G
And I'll be me

                    F         C
Everything's that's broooooke
                Am         G
Leave it to the breeeeeeeeze
                 F        C
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
             G
And I'll be me

And I'll be me



[Instrumental]

C  F  Am7  G x2


[Verse]

C                        F                 Am   G
    From throwin' clothes across the floor
C                        F                         Am   G
    To teeth and clothes and slammin' doors at you
C                       F                         Am   G
    If this is all we're livin' for
           C                    F                 Am   G
Why are we doin' it, doin' it, doin' it anymore


[Pre-Chorus]
           Am              G
I used to recognize myself
                             Am/F#      Fmaj7
It's funny how reflections change
            Am                   G
And we're becomin' somethin' else
                          Am/F#
I think it's time to walk away


[Chorus]
                  F         C
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Am          G
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  F        C
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              G
And I'll be me

                    F         C
Everything's that's broooooke
                Am         G
Leave it to the breeeeeeeeze
                 F        C
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
             G
And I'll be me

And I'll be me


[Instrumental]

C  F  Am7  G x2


[Bridge]

Dm                                 Am
Tryin' to fit your hand inside of mine

When we know it just don't belong
G
There's no force on earth
                   F
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Dm                                 Am
Tryin' to push this problem up the hill

When it's just too heavy to hold
G                              F
Think now's the time to let it slide


[Chorus]

                  F         C
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Am         G
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  F        C
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              G
And I'll be me

                    F        C
Everything's that's broooooooke
                 Am        G
Leave it to the breeeeeeeeeeeze
               F           C
Let the ashes faaaaaaaaalllll
              G
Forget about me

                  F         C
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Am         G
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  F        C
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              G
And I'll be me
             C
And I'll be me
