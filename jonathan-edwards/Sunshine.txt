Jonathan Edwards - Sunshine

Capo I

A                                               E
Sunshine go away today  I don't feel much like dancing.
A                                                                     D
Someone's come he's trying to run my life don't believe what he's asking.
A                                                            E
He tells me I'd better get in line, don't believe what he's saying
A                                                                     D
When I grow up I'm going to make it mine but these aren't dues I been paying

Chorus:
     D                 A
But how much does it cost? (I'll buy it)
     D                 A
The time is all we've lost (I'll try it)
D                  A
but he can't even run his own life
        G                   E
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine

A                                               E
Sunshine go away today  I don't feel much like dancing.
A                                                                     D
Someone's come he's trying to run my life don't believe what he's asking.
A                                                                    E
Working starts to make you wonder where the fruits of what I do are going
A                                                                     D
He says in love and war all is fair but he's got cards he ain't showing

[chorus]

A                                                      E
Sunshine come on back another day pretty soon I'll be singing
A                                                             D
This old world, gonna turn around brand new bells will be ringing

[chorus]
