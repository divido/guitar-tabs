CAPO 2

Intro
Am F  C  F  C

F
She lifts her skirt up to her knees
                                                  C
Walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughing
F
I never learned to count my blessings
                                    C
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters

Am
Walk on down the hill
            E
Through the grass grown tall and brown
               F                            C
And still it's hard somehow to let go of my pain
Am
On past the busted back
        E
Of this old and rusted Cadillac
     F                                C
That sinks into this field collecting rain

C         G   F    Am   E
Will I always feel this way
C      G  F  Am   E    E7
So empty, so estranged

Am

F
Of these cutthroat busted sunsets,
                                          C
These cold and damp white mornings I have grown weary
F
If through my cracked and dusty dime store lips
                                          C
I spoke these words out loud would no one hear me

Am
Lay your blouse across the chair
    E
Let fall the flowers from your hair
    F                                  C
And kiss me with that country mouth so plain
Am
Outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
E
To me it sounds like they're
F                                C
applauding us, the quiet love we make

C         G   F    Am   E
Will I always feel this way
C      G  F  Am   E    E7
So empty, so estranged

F
Well I looked my demons in the eyes
                                         C
Laid bare my chest said do your best and destroy me
F
See I've been to hell and back so many times
                         C
I must admit you kind of bore me

Am
There's a lot of things that can kill a man
           E
There's a lot of ways to die
        F                                 C
Yes and some already dead who walk beside you
Am
There's a lot of things I don't understand
       E
Why so many people lie
F                                                C
Well it's the hurt you hide that fuels the fires inside you

C         G   F    Am   E
Will I always feel this way
C      G  F  Am   E    E7
So empty, so estranged
