A                 G                           D 
Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you.
      A                    G                D
It's late September and I really should be back at school.
  G                   D          G              A  
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used.
    Em                     F#m       Em     Asus  A
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more.
    Em                A            Em                   A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone.
     Em                  A                  D
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts. 

     A                    G                     D 
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age.
     A                   G                       D
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything.
   G                    D        G                       A  
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax. 
     Em                    F#m      Em     Asus   A 
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more. 
     Em               A            Em                  A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone.
    Em                     A                D
You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without.

A                  G                  D
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand.
          A                      
But you turned into a lover,
 G                       D
and mother what a lover you wore me out.
 G                       D               
All you did was wreck my bed
G                     A
and in the morning kick me in the head.  
     Em                    F#m      Em    Asus   A 
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more.  
    Em                A               Em                 A
You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone. 
     Em                         A              D
You stole my heart; I couldn't leave you if I tried.

A                      G                     D
I suppose I should collect my books and get back to school.
     A               G                        D
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool.
    G                           D         G               A
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand. 
     Em               F#m             Em    Asus   A 
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
           Em                      A               
You made a first class fool out of me,
Em                A
but I'm as blind as a fool can be 
    Em                    A          D
You stole my heart but I love you anyway.
