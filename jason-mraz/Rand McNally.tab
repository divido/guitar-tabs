Who is he, Mr. Rand Mcnally?

I had I dream that mystery was me. Now who else could I be?



I dreamed I went to England and met the spice girls there for tea

They lost one more they're down from four to my favorite number three

But they're still quite spicy as the orange flavor

And oh so nice to do me the favor and lick my icing under the table now

But I gotta leave town mr. Nally, just as scary spice was about to go down on me

And don't ask how mr. Nally and give up the towel mr. Nally and run



I dreamed I went to Singapore got bored and robbed a liquor store

What for? Nobody knows I only took a couple of Marlboros

Oh but that was all they needed and the criminal was soon defeated

And now in jail I'm waiting for my punishment of caning

So I gotta think fast Mr. Nally watch your ass, wake up and laugh and run.



Better Mr run, mr rand, mr mac, mr nally

Mr run, mr man, you got the knack for the rally And run



I had a chance to visit the north pole but it was way too cold to smoke

Oh my nose was freezing I should could do some coughing and wheezing

So I tried it anyway and the place went up in flames

How was I suppose to know you could catch fire to the snow

Oh lord way to go mr nally, way to go, now you're melting the poles mr nally so run.



I jumped ship in NYC and headed south to Washington DC

Didn't think I'd go there but played some shows there fancy lucky me

But it is really slow there with our new president on TV

Too many politicians and liberal Christians they're all set out for me

Singing cast your vote mr nally, castrate your vote, no you don't, just run



I thumbed a ride across the prairie, I got hitched in Vegas, yep, I got married

To a lady who left me she thought it's be funny to gamble all my money

And I got stranded without my clothes, a little bit of fear and loathing heart attack

I got chased by the rat pack once in a flashback. Singing viva Las Vegas



I settled down in san diego and smoked a joint with java joe

And with a grin he took me in, I spilled coffee on my chin

and i played my show there and met my bitches and hoes there

and with my holy host they kindly let me shake my tail there

but one more thing before we go, there's never been any place quite like this home

for once in a life time maybe, i'd be foolish not to stay

oh i got to get away mr. nally what can i say mr. nally.. run run run run run away mr. nally
