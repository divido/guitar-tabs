CAPO 3RD FRET


[Verse]

Am                     C
 I don’t know where I’m at
                    G
I’m standing at the back
                    F
And I’m tired of waiting
Am              C
 Waiting here in line,
                 G
Hoping that I’ll find
                  F
What I’ve been chasing


[Chorus]
C               G
 I shot for the sky
                  Am
I’m stuck on the ground
             F
So why do I try, I know I’m gonna to fall down
C                  G                  Am
 I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
           F                                Am C G F
Never know why it’s coming down, down, down.


[Verse]

Am                C
 Not ready to let go
                        G
Cause then I'd never know
                  F
What I could be missing
Am                        C
 But I’m missing way too much
                  G
So when do I give up
                F
what I’ve been wishing for


[Chorus]

C               G
 I shot for the sky
                  Am
I’m stuck on the ground
             F
So why do I try, I know I’m gonna to fall down
C                  G                  Am
 I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
           F                              G
Never know why it’s coming down, down, down.
   F                      C
Oh I am going down, down, down
      G                 Am
Can’t find another way around
    F                        C          G                   F
And I don’t want to hear the sound, of losing what I never found

C               G
 I shot for the sky
                  Am
I’m stuck on the ground
             F
So why do I try, I know I’m gonna to fall down
C                  G                  Am
 I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
           F
Never know why it’s coming down, down, down

C               G
 I shot for the sky
                  Am
I’m stuck on the ground
             F
So why do I try, I know I’m gonna to fall down
C                  G                  Am
 I thought I could fly, so why did I drown?
           F                                Am C G F
Never know why it’s coming down, down, down.
