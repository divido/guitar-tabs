  Intro:      Am    F    C    G     x4


 Am            F               C      G
 Ever wonder about what he's doing
 Am          F             C      G
 How it all turned to lies
 Am             F             C      G
 Sometimes I think that it's better
    Am      F      C    G
 To never ask why

 Am    F     C    G   x2


                   F
 Where there is desire
                       C
 There is gonna be a flame
                    G
 Where there is a flame
                        Am
 Someone's bound to get burned
                      F
 But just because it burns
                            C
 Doesn't mean you're gonna die
                  G               Am
 You've gotta get up and try try try
            F              C
 Gotta get up and try try try
               G
 You gotta get up and try try
  Am    F    C    G    Am    F    C    G
 Try


 Am             F               C      G
 Funny how the heart can be deceiving
  Am               F           C      G
 More than just a couple times
Am          F               C      G
 Why do we fall in love so easy
Am               F        C      G
 Even when it's not right

 Am    F    C    G  x2


                   F
 Where there is desire
                       C
 There is gonna be a flame
                    G
 Where there is a flame
                        Am
 Someone's bound to get burned
                      F

 Am            F                C      G
 Ever worried that it might be ruined
      Am               F          C     G
 And does it make you wanna cry?
  Am                     F                 C     G
 When you're out there doing what you're doing
 Am            F          C     G
 Are you just getting by?
          Am           F          C    G
