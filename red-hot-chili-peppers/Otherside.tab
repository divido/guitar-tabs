   I heard your voice through a photogragh
   Am                          Em
   It thought it up it brought up the past
   Am                     Em
   Once you know you can never go back
                G              Am
   I've got to take it on the otherside
   Am                     Em
   Centuries are what it meant to me
   Am                  Em
   A cemetery where I marry the sea
   Am                           Em
   Stranger things could never change my mind
                G              Am
   I've got to take it on the otherside
    G              Am
   Take it on the otherside
    G          Am
   Take it on take it on

   The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
   Am                      Em
   She wants to know am I still a slut
                G              Am
   I've got to take it on the otherside
   Am                         Em
   Scarlet starlet and she is in my bed
   Am                  Em
   A candidate for my soul mate bled
   Am                   Em
   Push the trigger and pull the thread
                G              Am
   I've got to take it on the otherside
    G              Am
