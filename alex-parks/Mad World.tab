Verse:

Bm                 D
All around me are familiar faces,
A                 E
Worn out places, worn out faces.
Bm                         D
Bright and early for their daily races,
A               E
Going nowhere, going nowhere.
Bm                          D
And their tears are filing up their glasses,
A               E
No expression, no expression.
Bm                       D
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow,
A            E
No tomorrow, no tomorrow.


Chorus:
Bm                           E
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad.
Bm                            E
The dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had.
Bm                           E
I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take.
Bm                          E
When people run in circles, it's a very very
Bm     E   Bm   E
Mad world, mad world.

Bm                 D
Children waiting for the day they feel good
A               E
Happy birthday, happy birthday.
Bm                 D
Made to feel the way that every child should
A               E
Sit and listen, sit and listen.
Bm                 D
Went to school and I was very nervous,
A               E
No on knew me, no one knew me.
Bm                 D
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson,
A                       E
Look right through me, look right through me.

Bm                           E
I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take.
Bm                          E
When people run in circles, it's a very very
Bm     E   Bm   E
Mad world, mad world
Bm     E   Bm   E
Mad world, mad world.
