winter song ft ingrid michaelson

Capo on First fret

Am              G       C
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
C       G       F
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
F        C       Am
Bum bum bum bum bum bum

Am            G        C
This is my winter song to you
C                Am  F
The storm is coming soon
F           C       Am
It rolls in from the sea
Am            G          C
My voice a beacon in the night
C             Am      F
My words will be your light
F        C      Am
To carry you to me

         F
Is love alive?
         G
Is love alive?
       C Am
Is love...

Am     G  C        F     C  Am

Am                   G           C
They say that things just cannot grow
C            Am    F
Beneath the winter snow
F       C         Am
Or so I have been told
Am              G    C
They say were buried far
C           Am      F
Just like a distant star
F        C      Am
I simply cannot hold


         F
Is love alive?
         G
Is love alive?
         C       Am
Is love alive?

     E    F      G
This is my winter song.
Am   E        F       G
December never felt so wrong
Am           E        F
Cause you're not where you belong
F  Am  G  C
Inside my arms

Am              G       C
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
C         Am     F
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
F               C   Am
Bum bum bum bum bum bum

Am                G      C
I still believe in summer days
C            Am    F
The seasons always change
F             C      Am
And life will find a way

Am             G         C
Ill be your harvester of light
C           Am  F
And send it out tonight
F         C     Am
So we can start again

         F
Is love alive?
         G
Is love alive?
         C       Am
Is love alive?

     E     F       G
This is my winter song
Am   E        F       G
December never felt so wrong
Am           E         F
Cause you're not where you belong
F   Am G  C
Inside my arms

Am            G          C
This is my winter song to you.
C               Am   F
The storm is coming soon
F            C       Am
It rolls in from the sea

Am            G        C
My love a beacon in the night
C             Am       F
My words will be your light

To carry you to me
