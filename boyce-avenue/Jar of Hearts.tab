Jar of Hearts
Christina Perri (This tab for the Boyce Avenue/Tiffany Alvord Cover)

--- Verse 1 ------------------------------------------------
(Single Strums)
Dm                             F
   I know I can't take one more step towards you

C                               Gm
  'Cause all thats waiting is regret

Dm                                F
   And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore

C                              Gm
  You lost the love I loved the most

(Normal Strums)
Gm              Bb   Dm     C
   I learned to live half a life

Gm            Bb              C
  And now you want me one more time


--- Chorus -------------------------------------------------
(Single Strums again)

F                         C
    Who do you think you are?

                       Dm
Running 'round leaving scars

                    Bb
Collecting a jar of hearts

Bbm           F
Tearing love apart

                     C
You're gonna catch a cold

                         Dm
From the ice inside your soul

                    Bb
Don't come back for me

Bbm                  F
Who do you think you are?


--- Verse 2 ------------------------------------------------
(On-beat Downstrums, Intimidating)

Dm                           F
   I hear you're asking all around

C                        Gm
  If I am anywhere to be found

Dm                      F
   But I have grown too strong

C                           Gm
  To ever fall back in your arms

(Normal strumming)
Gm                 Bb   Dm     C
   I've learned to live half a life

  And now you want me one more time

Tearing love apart

From the ice inside your soul

Don't come back for me

Who do you think you are?

--- Bridge -------------------------------------------------
(Cold, empty)
Dm          F           Am       Gm
It took so long just to feel alright

  Dm            F            Am          Gm
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes

  Dm         F                Am           Gm
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed

       Dm        F        C    Gm
'Cause you broke all your promises

    Bb
And now you're back

                 C
You don't get to get me back
