Intro: Dm, C, Dm, C x5

Verse:
Dm       C              Dm      C     Dm   C  Dm C
Now and then I think of when we were together
Dm            C                Dm     C        Dm  C Dm C
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Dm     C                  Dm         C
Told myself that you were right for me
Dm           C             Dm      C
But felt so lonely in your company
Dm            C                Dm       C     Dm    C  Dm  C
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

Bridge: Dm, C, Dm, C x4

Verse 2:
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

Chorus:
Dm      C              Bb     C
But you didn't have to cut me off
Dm        C            Bb
Make out like it never happened
         C          Dm
And that we were nothing
    C             Bb       C
And I don't even need your love
         Dm              C
But you treat me like a stranger
          Bb       C
And that feels so rough
Dm    C              Bb      C
You didn't have to stoop so low
Dm         C                   Bb
Have your friends collect your records
          C           Dm
And then change your number
  C                  Bb          C
I guess that I don't need that though
Dm               C              Bb      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Verse 3:
Dm       C             Dm                  C          Dm  C Dm C
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Dm          C                Bb              C      Dm   C Dm C
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
Dm    C            Bb       C
And I don't wanna live that way
Dm       C          Bb      C
Reading into every word you say
Dm   C                   Bb     C
You said that you could let it go
Dm                       C              Bb            C
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

Chorus:
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Dm C  Bb  C
I used to know
Dm  C  Bb       C
That I used to know x2

Dm C Bb C
Somebody...

Ends on Dm
