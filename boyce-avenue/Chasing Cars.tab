If I lay here, if I just lay here
              C                                   G
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.

I don't quite know how to say how I feel

If I lay here, if I just lay here

Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.

Show me a garden that's bursting into life.

<<One Strum>

If I lay here, if I just lay here
              C                                  G
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
