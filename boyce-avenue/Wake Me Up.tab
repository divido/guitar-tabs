Intro:  Am  F   C   G
        Am  F   C   G



Am         F              C      C
Feeling my way through the darkness

Am     F            C    C
Guided by a beating heart

Am      F              C         C
I can’t tell where the journey will end

Am    F             C     C
But I know where it starts

Am           F                C       C
They tell me I’m too young to understand

Am           F              C     C
They say I’m caught up in a dream

Am             F               C          C
Well life will pass me by if I don’t open up my eyes

Am          F       C   C
Well that’s fine by me





           Am      F        C  G
So wake me up when it’s all over

         Am    F       C  G
When I’m wiser and I’m older

         Am         F       C  G
All this time I was finding myself

      Am     F          C  G
And I didn’t know I was lost

           Am      F        C  G
So wake me up when it’s all over

         Am    F       C  G
When I’m wiser and I’m older

         Am         F       C  G
All this time I was finding myself

      Am     F          C  G
And I didn’t know I was lost







I tried carrying the weight of the world


But I only have two hands


Hope I get the chance to travel the world


And I don’t have any plans


Wish that I could stay forever this young


Not afraid to close my eyes


Life’s a game made for everyone


And love is a prize






So wake me up when it’s all over


When I’m wiser and I’m older


All this time I was finding myself


And I didn’t know I was lost


So wake me up when it’s all over


When I’m wiser and I’m older


All this time I was finding myself


And I

I didn’t know I was lost

I didn’t know I was lost

I didn’t know I was lost

I didn’t know I was lost

I didn’t know I (didn’t know I, didn’t know I)
