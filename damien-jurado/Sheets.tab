Capo 1

Strum the top three strings with your thumb
and alternate picking G and B. For the intro,
on C he takes his finger off the D string and
puts it back on before switching to C6. Hope
you enjoy my first tab.


[Intro]

Dm  F  C6  A#


[Verse]

   Dm                F                     C6              A#
Is he still coming around like an injured bird needing a nest?
           Dm       F         C6              A#
A place to rest his head in a song you'll regret
          Dm               F                       C6
Still you take him, Lord knows I don't want to compete
            A#                   Dm    F         C6    A#
But still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in


[Chorus]

             Dm           F                    C6
Swallow him whole like a pill that makes you choke and stills
      A#
your soul
              Dm              F                C6    A#
You have the nerve to look me in the eyes and lie
          Dm
Send him back
       F                 C6          A#
I'll share the trap that you have me in


[Bridge]

Dm  F  C6  A#


[Verse]

   Dm                F                     C6             A#
Is he still coming around like an injured bird needing a nest?
           Dm        F         C6            A#
A place to rest his head in a song you'll regret
           Dm             F                        C6
Still you take him, Lord knows I don't want to compete
            A#                   Dm    F        C6   A#
But still I sleep in the very sheets he's been in


[Chorus]

             Dm           F                    C6
Swallow him whole like a pill that makes you choke and stills
      A#
your soul
              Dm              F                C6    A#
You have the nerve to look me in the eyes and lie
          Dm
Send him back
       F                  C6         A#
I'll share the trap that you have me in
