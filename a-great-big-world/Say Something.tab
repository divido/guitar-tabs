Say Something
A Great Big World

Bm                G                D        Asus
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Bm              G                  D        Asus
  I'll be the one, if you want me to.
Bm          G                    D         Asus
  Anywhere, I would've followed you.
Bm               G                D        Asus
  Say something, I'm giving up on you.

    D                F#m
And I am feeling so small.
        G
It was over my head
                  D     Asus
I know nothing at all.

    D                   F#m
And I will stumble and fall.
            G
I'm still learning to love
                 D     Asus
Just starting to crawl.

Bm                G                D       Asus
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Bm                G                  D     Asus
   I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.
Bm           G              D      Asus
   Anywhere, I will follow you.
Bm                G                D        Asus
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.


    D                  F#m
And I will swallow my pride.
            G
You're the one that I love
                   D        Asus
And I'm saying goodbye.

Bm               G                D        Asus
