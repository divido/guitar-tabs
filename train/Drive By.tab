Intro:
C#m - C#m

Verse 1:
C#m                                    A
  On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you
E                          B
I guess that's déjà vu But I thought this can't be true
      C#m                      A
Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
   E                           B
Or where ever to get away from me

Pre-Chorus:
F#m                   A
 Oh but that one night Was more than just right
C#m                B
 I didn't leave you cause I was all through
F#m                  A
 Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
G#                 G#7
 Because I really fell for you

Chorus:
A                E                    B                   C#m  B
 Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya This is not a drive by
A              E                   B                    Cdim
 Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my love
A                 E                   B                       C#m
 When you move me everything is groovy They don't like it sue me
             B     A               E
 The way you do me Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya
F#m                 G#7
 This is not a drive by

Verse 2:
C#m                                    A
 On the other side of a downward spiral My love for you went viral
E                          B              C#m
 And I loved you every mile you drove away But now here you are again
   A
 So let's skip the "how you been"
    E                                   B
 And get down to the "more than friends" at last

Pre-Chorus:
F#m                   A
 Oh but that one night Was still the highlight
C#m                B
 I didn't neeed you until I came to
F#m                 A
 And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
G#                 G#7
 Because I really fell for you



Chorus:
A                E                    B                   C#m  B
 Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya This is not a drive by
A              E                   B                    Cdim
 Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my love
A                 E                   B                       C#m
 When you move me everything is groovy They don't like it sue me
             B     A               E
 The way you do me Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya
F#m                 G#7
 This is not a drive by

Bridge:
F#m7      C#m       A       B  A
Please believe that when I leave
        G#            C#m
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for
B
You And a little time to get my head together too

Verse 3:
C#m                                  A
 On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you
E                          B
 I guess that's déjà vu But I thought this can't be true, Cause
