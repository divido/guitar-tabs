[Verse]

    Am
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, what have I done?

I've fallen in love with a (girl) on the run
    Am
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I'm begging you please
       Dm                   Am
Don't take that sinner from me
         Dm                   Am
Oh don't take that sinner from me


    Am
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, what do I do?
       G                                   Am
I've fallen for someone who's nothing like you
          Am
(She's) raised on the edge of the devil's backbone
     Dm                       Am
Oh I just want to take (her) home
     Dm                       Am
Oh I just want to take (her) home


[Chorus]

Am   G  Dm  Am
Oooooooooh
Am   G  Dm  Am
Oooooooooh


[Verse]

    Am
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, (she's) somewhere between
     G                                 Am
A hangman's knot, and three mouths to feed
        Am
There wasn't a wrong or a right (she) could choose
      Dm                    Am
(She) did what (she) had to do
      Dm                   Am
(She) did what (she) had to do


[Chorus]

Am   G  Dm  Am
Oooooooooh
Am   G  Dm  Am
Oooooooooh


[Verse]

Am                  G
Give me the burden, give me the blame
      Dm                          F
I'll shoulder the load, and I'll swallow the shame
Am                   G
Give me the burden, give me the blame
     Dm                   F
How many, how many Hail Mary's is it gonna take?


       Am
Don't care if (she's) guilty, don't care if (she's) not
          G                                              Am
(she's) good and (she's) bad, and (she's) all that I've got
    Am
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I'm begging you please
      Dm                    Am
Don't take (my) sinner from me
         Dm                   Am
Oh don't take (my) sinner from me
