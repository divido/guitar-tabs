Ghosts that we knew

As close as I can get to the CD version.

No Capo

    C   Em Am           G   F      C
You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
C  Em   Am            G         F      C
Broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
        C   Em Am       G      F    C
But you saw no fault no cracks in my heart
        C     Em Am     G    F    C
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart


        E7             Am      E7         Am
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
            C       G   C
And we will live a long life


           F            C             G             C
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
       F      C               G
Cause oh that gave me such a fright
    Am     G        F          C
But I will hold as long as you like
     F           G           Am      F     Am     G
Just promise me we will be alright

   C    Em  Am        G     F      C
So lead me back, turn south from that place
    C     Em Am         G F     C
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
          C    Em  Am
Cause you know my call
        G     F  C
We will share my all
        C   Em   Am                 G    F  C
And our children come and they will hear me roar


           F            C             G             C
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
       F      C               G
Cause oh that gave me such a fright
    Am     G        F          C
But I will hold as long as you like
     F          G             Am    F    C
Just promise me we will be alright

Am      F       C

    Am          F                      C
But hold me still bury my heart on the cold
    Am          F                      C
But hold me still bury my heart next to yours

           F            C             G             C
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
       F      C               G
Cause oh that gave me such a fright
    Am     G        F          C
But I will hold with all of my might
     F          G             C      (Here they play C and F in A pattern)
Just promise me we will be alright   (Just listen to the song to get it)

        E7            Am          E7           Am
But the ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
            C       G   C
But we'll live a long life

C

        E7            Am        E7          Am
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
            C       G   C
And we will live a long life
