[Verse 1]

           C                 G
So we were up, throwing dice in the dark
           Am        G              Am
I saw you late, last night, come to harm
          C            G       C
I saw you dance in the devil's arms
               C                        G
The night kept coming, really nothing I could do
            Am         G         Am
Eyes with a fire, unquenched, by peace
          C     G           C
Curse the beauty, curse the queen


[Chorus]

G     Am         Em       F    C
So we come, to a place of no return
G            Am         Em       F    C
Yours is the face, that makes my body burn
G               Am   Em       F          C
And here is the name that our sons will learn
C           G11               Am
  Curse the beauty, curse the queen
C           G             C
  Curse the beauty, leave me

[Verse 2]

               C                  G
So when you're weak, when you are on your knees
           Am             G            Am
I'll do my best, with the time, that's left
                C       G            C
Sworn with your spirit, you're fully fleshed
             C                             G
So fuck your dreams, and don't you pick at our seams
                 Am                  G                 Am
I'll turn into a monster for you, If you pay me enough
             C            G                 C
None of this counts a few dreams, plowed up


[Chorus]

G     Am         Em       F    C
So we come, to a place of no return
G            Am         Em       F    C
Yours is the face, that makes my body burn
G               Am   Em       F          C
And here is the name that our sons will learn
C           G11               Am
  Curse the beauty, curse the queen
C           G             C
  Curse the beauty, leave me
