Winter Winds

INTRO:

  C    G    Am     F (x2)

VERSE 1:

        C     G            Am                 F
As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
        C             G              Am         F
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
        C                    G           Am             F
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
    C               G                 Am         F
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt


CHORUS:

       F            C
And my head told my heart
 F    C    G
"Let love grow"
       F             C
But my heart told my head
  F    C   G                 C
"This time no, this time no..."


VERSE 2:

           C        G          Am     F
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
         C          G              Am             F
And the time we were given will be left for the world
     C                    G            Am          F
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
    C                  G         Am        F
So let the memories be good for those who stay... hey!


CHORUS:

       F            C
And my head told my heart
 F    C    G
"Let love grow"
       F             C
But my heart told my head
  F    C   G                 C
"This time no, this time no..."



VERSE 3:  (Strum chords only once)

       C                  G            Am              F
Oh the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
        C          G       Am       F
Was the same that sent me into your arms
       C             G                Am            F
Oh and pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
       C        G         Am    F
And no hope, no hope will overcome


(Bring back to normal strumming)
            C      G          Am    F
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
           C     G      Am        F
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
  C        G          Am       F
You'll be happy and wholesome again
         C     G         Am     F
When the city clears and sun ascends... hey!

PAUSE

SOLO:

  C        G          Am       F  (x2)


CHORUS:

       F            C
And my head told my heart
 F    C    G
"Let love grow"
       F             C
But my heart told my head
  F    C   G
"This time no..."

       F            C
And my head told my heart
 F    C    G
"Let love grow"
       F             C
But my heart told my head
  F    C   G                 C
"This time no, this time no..."
