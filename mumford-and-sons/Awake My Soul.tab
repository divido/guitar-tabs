C                           F        C
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
C                       F            C
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
C                            F              C
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
C                           F       C
This weakness I feel I must finally show

C                            F           C
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
C                               F            C
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
C                       F               C
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
C                            F       C
But your soul you must keep, totally free
C   F    F   C    C   F C
Har har, har har, har har, har har

Am       C     Am       C

I struggle to find any truth in your lies
C                            F              C
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
