          G           C                  G
You were cold as the blood through your bones
         C               G                Em
And the light which led us from our chosen homes
   C        G
Well I was lost

           G
And now I sleep
           C              G
Sleep the hours and that I don't weep
        C                G                 Em
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
 C     G
I was lost

Em      C       G       D
Keep the earth below my feet
Em      C       G          D
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Em      C       G          D
Let me learn from where I have been
        C          Em     C           G
Keep my eyes to serve and hands to learn
D       C          Em     C           G
Keep my eyes to serve and hands to learn

        G
So I was still
     C              G
I was under your spell
       C             G            Em
When I was told by Jesus all was well
     C          G
So all must be well

              G
Just give me time
         C                G
You know your desires and mine
         C         G           Em
Wrap my flesh in ivory and in twine
   C           G
For I must be well


Em      C       G       D
Keep the earth below my feet

Let me learn from where I have been

Keep my eyes to serve and hands to learn

Keep my eyes to serve and hands to learn
