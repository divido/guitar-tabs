Apologies it's not perfect but it should help,
I wrote out the words so some need changing
Please rate if you like the song and tab

(Guitar to emphasize bass)

[Intro]
C

[Verse 1]
C                          C                      G       F
there is no great thing to stop and sing, waiting for the rain
         C                  C                   G         F    Am    G
and this perfect pill, it’s all too much on the edge again
               F    Am    G
don’t look away

C          C               C                    G        F
  couldn't help but note a cold disdain in your precious face
           C                     C                     G        F
why do you always speak when you have no grace in your precious face

[Chorus 1]
F          Am              G                        F
but even in the dark, I saw you were the only one alone
               Am                  G                                                F
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol though you swore you wouldn’t do this anymore
              Am              G
And I can't be for you, all of the things that you want me to.
     F                Am                  G
but I will love you constantly there's precious little else (for) me
      Am      G           C
and though we cry we must stay alive

Am  G   C

[Verse 2]
          C                C                         G     F
another fragile edge and a tender sound and then you went aground
       C                      C                            G              F
Near a duller blade a promise out of sight there’s nothing here for you tonight

[Chorus 2]
F          Am              G                        F
but even in the dark, I saw you were the only one alone
               Am                  G                                                F
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol though you swore you wouldn’t do this anymore
              Am              G
And I can't be for you, all of the things that you want me to.
     F                Am                  G
but I will love you constantly there's precious little else (for) me

[Bridge]
    Am       G           C
and though we cry we must stay alive
       Am             G           C
let my blood only run out when my world decides
         Am     G           C
there is no way out of your only life
       Am      G        C
so run on, run on, (run on)

       Am      G        C
so run on, run on, (run on)
