Broken Crown
Mumford and Sons

Dm     C      Bb  Am   C/E  F  Gm C  Dm

 Dm       Am        Dm
Touch my mouth and hold my tongue
Dm         Am       Dm
I'll never be your chosen one
        Bb   Am              Dm
I'll be home safe and tucked away
         Bb
Well you can't tempt me
   Am               Dm
If I don't see  the day

    Dm         Am        Dm
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
   Dm       Am          Dm
Stifled the choice and the air in my lungs
       Bb      Am                  Dm
Better not to breathe to breathe a lie
             Bb      Am              Dm
Cause when I open my body I breathe a lie

Dm     C      Bb  Am   C/E  F  Gm C  Dm

Dm         Bb   Dm Am Dm  C   Dm
I will not speak of      your sin
Dm         Bb   Dm Am Dm  C   Dm
There was a way out       for him
Dm         Bb   Dm Am Dm  C   Dm
The mirror shows              not
Dm          Bb Dm Am Dm  C   Dm
Your values are           all shot



    Dm C   Dm    C   Dm    C  Dm  F  Bb
But oh my heart was flawed I knew my weakness
   Dm   C   Dm   C  Dm   C  Dm F  Bb
So hold my hand consign me not to darkness

Dm     C      Bb  Am   C/E  F  Gm C  Dm


Dm           Am             Dm
Crawl on my belly until the sun goes down
Dm          Am              Dm
I'll never wear your broken crown
           Bb       Am           Dm
I took the road and fucked it all away
     Bb           Am                 Dm
This twilight how dare you speak of grace

Dm           Am             Dm
Crawl on my belly until the sun goes down
Dm          Am              Dm
I'll never wear your broken crown
           Bb       Am           Dm
I took the road and fucked it all away
     Bb           Am                 Dm
This twilight how dare you speak of grace

C/E  F  Gm C  Dm

Dm           Am             Dm
Crawl on my belly until the sun goes down
Dm          Am              Dm
I'll never wear your broken crown
               Bb             Am          Dm
I can take the road and I can fuck it all the way
            Bb         Am             Dm
In this twilight our choices seal our fate
