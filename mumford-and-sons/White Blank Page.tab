In loving you with my whole heart,
   G           Am               F              G
Oh tell me now where was my fault,

Am
A white blank page,
                        F   C       F     C
And a swelling rage,     rage,
Am
You did not think,

When you sent me,
          F       C           F     C
To the brink,     the brink,
Am
You desired my attention,
                       F           C           F              C
But denied my affections, my affections.

CHORUS

So, tell me now where was my fault,
In loving you with my whole heart.
Oh tell, me now where was my fault,
In loving you with my whole heart.

G          Am          F                G
Ahhh, ahhh, ah ahhhh ah ahhhhh.....
G            Am      F               G
Lead me to the truth and i,
   G                 Am        F                 G
Will follow you with my whole lie,
G             Am       F             G
Lead me to the truth and i,
    G               Am          F               G             Am
Will follow you with my whole lie....
