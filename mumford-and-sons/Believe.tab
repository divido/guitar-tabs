INTRO: Bm (can be played as Bsus2)

VERSE:
         Bm7
You may call it in this evening
           Asus4           A
But you've only lost the night
       Bm7
Preset all your pretty feelings
         Asus4          A
May they comfort you tonight
          Bm7
And I'm climbing over something
         Asus4                 A
And I'm running through these walls


CHORUS:
               G
I don't even know if I believe
               Bm7
I don't even know if I believe
               D
I don't even know if I believe
                    A
Everything you're trying to say to me


Bm7   | Asus4  A   x2


VERSE:
   Bm7
I had the strangest feeling
      Asus4               A
Your world's not all it seems
    Bm7
So tired of misconceiving
      Asus4                A
What else this could have been?


CHORUS:
              G
I don't even know if I believe
              D
I don't even know if I believe
              Bm7
I don't even know if I believe
                    A
Everything you're trying to say to me

               G
So open up my eyes
               D
Tell me I'm alive
               Bm7
This is never gonna go our way
                      A
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind


INSTRUMENTAL:
G   |Bm7   |D   |Em   F#m|

BRIDGE:
G
Well say something, say something
                     Bm7
Something like you love me
                  D
That you wanna move away
                Em
From the noise of this place


CHORUS:
              G
I don't even know if I believe
              D
I don't even know if I believe
              Bm7
I don't even know if I wanna believe
                     A
Anything you're trying to say to me

               G
So open up my eyes
               D
Tell me I'm alive
               Bm7
This is never gonna go our way
                      A
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

               G
So open up my eyes
               D
Tell me I'm alive
               Bm7
This is never gonna go our way
                      A
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Bm7
