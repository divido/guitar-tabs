    B        G             A           D
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
    E        B            E         F#
The days were short and the father was gone
          B            G        A             D
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
     E           B             E           F#
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield

          B            G           A         D
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
    E          B               E               F#
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
  B            G            A            D
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
     E      B               E       F#
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
   B           G              A         D
So collect your courage and collect your horse
     E            B             E        F#
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

Chorus 1
B      G         A        D
Seal my heart and break my pride
     E         B            E         F#
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
 B      G         A        D
Align my heart, my body, my mind
   E             B       E    F#
To face what I've done and do my time

      B        G            A          D
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
E             B            E        F#
Your opression reeks of your greed and disgrace
   B      G         A         D
So one man has and another has not
E          B           E          F#
How can you love what it is you have got
         B          G             A            D
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
E        B                   E         F#
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store

      B          G           A            D
There will come a time I will look in your eye
    E               B           E         F#
You will pray to the God that you always denied
    B          G             A      D
The I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
               E      B               E   F#
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

E B E F#

B      G         A        D
Seal my heart and break my pride
     E         B            E         F#
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
 B      G         A        D
Align my heart, my body, my mind
   E             B       E    F#
To face what I've done and do my time

(Instrumental Bridge)

     B       G        A          D
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
  E             B            E             F#
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
B         G          A      D
I went out back and I got my gun
             E      B               E   F#
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
