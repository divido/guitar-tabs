The Boxer
Mumford and Sons


C
I am just a poor boy
                         Am
Though my story's seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7             G6               C
For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
             Am
All lies and jests
        G                 F
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C    C
And disregards the rest

       C
When I left my home and my family
      C       G      Am
I was no more than a boy
       G
In the company of strangers
       G7           G6                  C
In the quiet of the railway station running scared
       Am           G               F
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
                        C
Where the ragged people go
         G             F               C
Looking for the places only they would know

        Am
Lie-la-lie
       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
       F                               C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

       C
Asking only workman's wages
       C       G     Am
I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers,
       G7               G6                C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
     Am                  G                   F
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
                    C
I took some comfort there


         C
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
    C       G      Am
And wishing I was gone
      G
Going home
          G7            G6             C
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Am                 G
Bleeding me, going home


Repeat chorus

During solo play the verse chord progression

       C
In the clearing stands a boxer
      C       G      Am
And a fighter by his trade
       G
And he carries the reminders
   G7               G6
Of ev'ry glove that layed him down
   C
Or cut him till he cried out
       Am            F
In his anger and his shame
      G              F
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
        C
But the fighter still remains

        Am
Lie-la-lie
       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
       F                               Am
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
       F                               C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie
