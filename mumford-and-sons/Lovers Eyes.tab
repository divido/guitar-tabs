Lovers' Eyes
Mumford and Sons

Capo 2

Intro: C G C (as if first two lines)

---

         C
Love was kind, for a time
         G                     C
Now just aches and it makes me blind

This mirror holds my eyes too bright
        G                    C
I can't see the others in my life

(Omit original interlude: C G C)

            C
Were we too young? Our heads too strong?
             G                       C
To bear the weight of these lover's eyes.

'Cause I feel numb, beneath your tongue
            G                      C
Beneath the curse of these lover's eyes.


            F               C
But do not ask the price I pay,
        G                  C
I must live with my quiet rage,
               F            C
(To) tame the ghosts in my head,
         G                C
That run wild and wish me dead.
                    F          C
Should you shake my ash to the wind
            G              C
(Please), forget all of my sins
           F           C
Oh, let me die where I lie
              G                    C* (Strong Beat 2, starting here)
(Beneath) the curse of my lovers' eyes.

C C F C

           C
There's no drink nor drug I tried
           G                      C
To rid the curse of these lover's eyes

And I feel numb, beneath your tongue
                     G                 C
Your strength just makes me feel less strong


            F               C
But do not ask the price I pay,
        G                  C
I must live with my quiet rage,
               F            C
(To) tame the ghosts in my head,
         G                C
That run wild and wish me dead.
                    F          C
Should you shake my ash to the wind
            G              C
(Please), forget all of my sins
           F           C
Oh, let me die where I lie
              G                    C
(Beneath) the curse of my lovers' eyes.

(Double Chorus, modification)

            F               C
But do not ask the price I pay,
        G                  C
I must live with my quiet rage,
               F            C
(To) tame the ghosts in my head,
         G                C
That run wild and wish me dead.
                    F          C
Should you shake my ash to the wind
            G              C
(Please), forget all of my sins
           F           C
Oh, let me die where I lie
              G                    C
(Beneath) the curse of my lovers' eyes.
