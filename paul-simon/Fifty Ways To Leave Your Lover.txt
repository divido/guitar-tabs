[Verse]

Em                 D           Cmaj7        B7
The problem is all inside your head she said to me,
Em7                D       Cmaj7         Edim
The answer is easy if you take it logically.
Em7               D                Cmaj7     B7   
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free.
          Em           Am7                Em
There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover.

Em                 D           Cmaj7        B7   
You know it's really not my habit to intrude,
Em                 D           Cmaj7        Edim
Furthermore I hope my meaning won't be lost or miss-construed,
Em                 D           Cmaj7        B7  
But I'll repeat myself, at the risk of being crude.
          Em           Am7                Em
There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover
G      Am7                Em
Fifty ways to leave your lover


[Chorus]

                      G                     Bb
Just slip out the back Jack, make a new plan Stan,
                  C7                    G
No need to be coy Roy, just listen to me
               G                      Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, don't need to discuss much,
                      C7                      G
Just drop off the key Lee, and set yourself free

                      G                     Bb
Just slip out the back Jack, make a new plan Stan,
                  C7                    G
No need to be coy Roy, just listen to me
               G                      Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, don't need to discuss much,
                      C7                      G
Just drop off the key Lee, and set yourself free


[Verse]

Em                 D           Cmaj7        B7  
You know it grieves me so to see you in such pain
Em                 D           Cmaj7              Edim 
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
Em                 D           Cmaj7            B7
I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain
           Em    Am7     Em
'Bout the fifty ways"

Em                 D           Cmaj7        B7  
She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight,
Em                 D           Cmaj7                    Edim 
And I believe that in the morning you'll begin to see the light."
Em                 D               Cmaj7        B7
She kissed me and I realised, she probably was right,
           Em                   Am7       Em 
There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover.
G         Am7             Em
Fifty ways to leave your lover

                  C7                    G
No need to be coy Roy, just listen to me
               G                      Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, don't need to discuss much,
                      C7                     G
Just drop off the key Lee, and set yourself free

                      G                     Bb
